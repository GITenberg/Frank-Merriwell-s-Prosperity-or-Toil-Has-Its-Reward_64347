  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>WHEN RAGE RULES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The scene was the stage of the Star Theater in Atchison,
Kansas, and the occasion the rehearsal of Frank
Merriwell’s company in his new play, “True Blue.”
From the first night “True Blue” had been a success;
the playgoers of Puleob, Colorado, who had witnessed the
failure of its first version, welcomed “True Blue” enthusiastically
and assured Frank, as Roscoe Havener,
his stage manager, had put it, that he had a “winner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank had chosen to turn back toward the East, instead
of continuing on to the Pacific coast, for it was late
in the season and business was on the decline. It would
be better for the members of his company if the play
closed its run in the East, leaving them on the ground
when the time came to make engagements for the coming
season. Besides that consideration, Frank had other reasons
in turning Eastward. The failure to keep the dates
made for “John Smith” and the partial failure of “For
Old Eli” had made it difficult for him to secure theaters
for “True Blue” on the Western route, while it was comparatively
easy to secure good bookings on the way Eastward.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it happened that the “True Blue” company had
jumped from Puleob straight across Colorado and Kansas
to Atchison, where they were to open that night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>All the actors, except Frank, were on the stage carefully
rehearsing, as Havener was determined that only by
constant drill could slips be avoided, and he aimed to
have a perfect performance.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the afternoon waned, more than one glance of comment
had been exchanged by the other players as they
witnessed Bart Hodge’s repeated acts of insubordination.
Bart seemed to be in a very unpleasant frame of mind,
favoring everybody with savage glances and paying absolutely
no attention to the directions of the stage manager.
In the eyes of actors there is no more unpardonable offense
than to treat the stage manager thus.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Havener was not the man to overlook such offenses.
Obviously he was incensed. But he understood
how close to Frank Bart was, how strong were Frank’s
feelings of friendship and loyalty to the dark-haired
youth, and he controlled his wrath until finally he could
tolerate the behavior of Hodge no longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He called out sharply:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, make your exit properly, please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Hodge gave Roscoe Havener an angry, resentful
look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you call me back for that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I certainly did,” answered the stage manager, grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because you took the wrong exit. I have told you repeatedly
to use the right upper at the close of that scene,
and you persist in leaving the stage by the right tormentor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the most convenient,” came sullenly from Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That makes no difference.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“It makes considerable difference to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener was angry, but he held himself in restraint.
He did not curse, after the manner of most stage managers,
but he showed that he meant what he said when he
spoke again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will do as I tell you at rehearsals, Mr. Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, will I?” said Bart, in a manner that was decidedly
insolent. “Oh, I don’t know!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know. Further than that, I will have no further
back talk from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how you will prevent it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are fined ten dollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is. Now you will make your exit in the proper
manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of that, Hodge walked off the stage by the
tormentor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener did not call him back again, but his face
turned pale with anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was in a dressing room, and did not hear
what took place on the stage between Havener and
Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deep in his heart Bart felt that he was wrong, but
he smothered the feeling, refused to pause to reason,
and hurried to the dressing room, where he knew he
would find Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was laying out his costumes and preparing
for the evening performance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge entered without knocking, and Merry knew in
a moment, on looking up, that something was wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, Merriwell!” he flared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter, old man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve stood enough of this! It’s the limit!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you talking about, Bart? What’s the
limit?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“Havener is the limit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think I understand you, my dear fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t ‘dear fellow’ me! I am in no mood to take
it now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plainly enough something serious had happened, for
Bart was not in the habit of talking that way. Frank
straightened up and looked at him steadily without speaking.
Bart’s eyes dropped before that gaze, but the
sullen look did not leave his face, and he stared at the
floor as if glaring at a deadly enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is this, anyway?” Merry asked, after some
moments. “What has gone wrong between you and
Havener?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am tired of being bulldozed by him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Havener is not in the habit of bulldozing anybody,
Hodge, as you very well know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know he is in the habit of trying it on me. He
doesn’t like me, and he doesn’t miss an opportunity to
try to call me down. I’m dead sick of it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are altogether too sensitive, old man. Havener
is the stage manager, and a good one he is, too. He
has aided me immensely in getting the play into shape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’re inclined to give other people too much
credit. I’ll guarantee there is not another playwriter
who is starring in his own piece who will say that his
stage manager has done much of anything for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not patterning my actions on those of others,
Bart. I detest chaps who ape others. I believe in individuality.
Be what you are. That is the maxim I
go by. If others are selfish and ungrateful, it is no
reason why I should be so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gratitude! gratitude! gratitude! It makes me tired!
Has a fellow got to go through the world being grateful
to everybody who is decent to him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know I did not mean that. You have a way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of distorting what I say so that it does not mean what
I intended.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes; of course I do something I shouldn’t do!
I’m always doing something I shouldn’t do! It’s been
the way all my life! At home I was forever doing
something I shouldn’t do! At school it was the same.
At college it was no better. And now, in trying to be
an actor, I am still doing something I should not do.
Oh, what’s the use to try to do anything! A fellow
might as well bump along and not give a rap what he
does or what happens to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are getting in a bad way, Hodge,” said Merriwell,
seriously. “I believe your liver is out of order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is no joking matter!” Bart snarled. “Don’t
poke fun at me, Frank Merriwell! It doesn’t go with
me for a cent!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you had been given a sense of humor it might
be better for you. Unfortunately, you never see the
humorous side of anything. You take everything seriously,
much to your own discomfort. Happy is the
man who can see and understand the humor in everyday
life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll guarantee there is nothing humorous in
what just happened on the stage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You haven’t told me what happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Havener gave me a call down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he! did he!” panted Bart. “You say that as if
it were of no consequence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Havener is not in the habit of giving anybody a
call down unless they deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s plain you think that fellow knows it all. But
I’m going to tell you now that I can’t stand his insolence,
and I won’t stand it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank sat down on the lid of his trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“We’ll have to talk this matter over, Bart,” he said.
“If Havener has given you a call down without cause,
you may be sure I shall have something to say to him.
Now, tell me just how it came about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But, of a sudden, Hodge did not feel like telling. He
began to realize that the truth would not put him in
a very favorable light. Instead of quieting his anger,
however, this made him feel still more angry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I haven’t anything to say about it!” he exclaimed,
turning away. “I’ll pay the fine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What fine?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ten dollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it is rather serious, for he fined you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you are just beginning to realize there is something
serious about it, are you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you wouldn’t blaze at me like that, Hodge.
Anyone would imagine we were the bitterest of foes,
instead of the firmest friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friends! Ha, ha! Are we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we?” echoed Merry, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, are we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, of course we are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know about that. I have no friends. I
wasn’t built to have friends. I believe I was intended for
an Ishmael.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, drop that, Hodge!” commanded Frank, not a
little shocked. “You were built for just what you
choose to make yourself. If you select to become an
outcast, you can do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is what you believe. I don’t believe anything
of the sort. I believe a fellow must be what he becomes.
I believe everything is predestined, and, try as he may,
no man can change the course that it has been destined
that he must follow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are getting into a bad way, Hodge, for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>is the argument of every evil-doer and criminal since
the days of Cain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it’s an argument that cannot be refuted!”
shouted Bart, fiercely. “I suppose that you claim God
is all-wise—that He knows everything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, if He knows everything, He must know before
a man is born just what that man will become, what
he will do, every act he will commit. You can’t deny
that. If He knows just what a man will do, then it
must be that the man’s actions are foreordained. You
can’t deny that. Every act that man does he was compelled
to do because God knew what he would do, and
he could not do differently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you would argue that a man should not attempt
to make himself better and nobler because he cannot
be any better if he tries? As I said before, that is
the argument of bad men and criminals for centuries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s enough!” Bart hissed. “I understand you,
Frank Merriwell. You—you, who have pretended to be
my friend—you have called me a criminal to my face.
Ha, ha, ha! I didn’t think it would come to that. Never
mind. I understand it all now. For all of our apparent
friendship, I know now that you have doubted me deep
down in your heart. You have not wanted to doubt
me, but you could not help it, and so——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank started toward Bart, his hand outstretched protestingly,
crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop! Has it come to this between us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it has come to this!” snarled the angry, unreasoning
youth. “Didn’t you know it would? Didn’t
you know I was a worthless fellow? Oh, yes, you knew
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you forgotten——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing. I have not forgotten what you have done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>for me, but I am sorry you ever did it. You have chosen
between me and Havener.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are wrong in——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not take a call down from any man living!”
shouted Bart. “Havener called me down. Havener is
your stage manager. He fined me. If you do not stand
by him, go out there and tell him he must apologize
to me—tell him he must retract that fine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge had not thought of making such a demand
when he entered the dressing room, but his anger had
led him on blindly till now reason was quite smothered
by passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know the facts of the case,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Confound the facts! You say you have not chosen
between us? Then you must stand by me. I tell you I
cannot take this call down from Havener. If you stand
by me, go out at once and inform him that he must apologize.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you are cooler you will look at this matter in
a different light. I’ll have a talk with you, then. I’ll
learn what has happened, and you may be sure I’ll not
uphold Havener if he is in the wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s not what I want. You have said you would
stand by me, even though you knew I might be in the
wrong. You are put to the test.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Again you distort the meaning of my words. If you
were charged with a wrong deed, I would stand by you—defend
you—do everything in my power for you. This
is different, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge cut Frank short with a bitter laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have been put to the test,” he again declared,
“and you have failed. It’s no use, Merriwell. I am an
Ishmael. Every man’s hand is against me, and my hand
is against all mankind. I don’t care what happens to
me now.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>He flung himself out of the dressing room before
Frank could say another word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was not left in a pleasant mood. He realized
that his arguments had been rather weak against those
made by Hodge, for he had been overwhelmed for the
moment by a tempest of angry words, and his modesty
had not permitted him to speak of the many instances of
his unswerving fidelity to the passionate, erring fellow in
the past. He had not been able to recall the many times
he had stood by Bart alone, even when the proof had
seemed overwhelming that Hodge had committed an
evil action or a crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank had been astounded by the seeming burst of
ingratitude from Bart, but he quickly decided that the
dark-faced youth would come to his senses if given time
to cool down and think over all the events that had transpired
since their first meeting on the little platform of
the railway station at Fardale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge, hot-blooded, passionate, unreasoning, had become
his enemy on their first meeting. In various ways
he had tried to injure and disgrace Merriwell, but he
had failed in all his efforts. When they had both become
cadets at the military academy, Hodge’s enmity had continued
till, being charged with a disgraceful deed of
which he was not guilty, Frank Merriwell had defended
him and proven his innocence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then these singularly assorted lads had become roommates
and chums, and time after time since had Frank
proved his loyalty by standing true to Hodge under the
most trying circumstances. In his calm reasoning moments,
Bart knew this and was grateful. He had been
ready enough to show his gratitude, but now anger had
overcome everything, and, in his burst of passion, he
had spoken words Frank had never expected to hear
from his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>At first Merry felt like following him. His own blood
was throbbing hotly in his veins on account of the injustice
with which he had been treated, but he had held
himself in check with a firm hand. Frank had learned
that the man who can master himself can master others,
and his self-control was something remarkable.</p>

<p class='c007'>He quickly decided that it would be best to give Bart
a chance to cool down somewhat. In the meantime, he
would learn exactly what had happened on the stage.
Merry hoped Bart’s sense of justice would reassert itself
and would bring the hot-blooded fellow back with a desire
to retract.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for Bart, he was so blind with passion that he
actually stumbled against Stella Stanley as he hurried
across the stage behind the rear setting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out!” she exclaimed, with a short laugh. “Do
you want to kill me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel like killing somebody!” panted Bart, glaring at
her; “but not you—not you, Miss Stanley,” he quickly
added.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you don’t want to take it that way,” she said.
“You’ll get used to it after you have been in the business
longer. We don’t get many call downs from Havener.
I’ve been in companies where the stage manager would
swear and tear around, and no member of the cast escaped
being hauled over the coals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No man can call me down that way!” exclaimed
Bart. “I won’t stand for it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your contract.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Haven’t any.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never had one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I supposed every member of the company had
a contract with Mr. Merriwell. How is it that you have
none?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never made any with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s queer; but you are friends, and I suppose he
thought it was not necessary. You are bound by——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bound by nothing! Do you think I’ll stay to take
such bullying? No! What difference did it make at
rehearsal whether I made the exit by the tormentor or
right upper?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know Havener insists on every member going
through rehearsal exactly as he will play so far as
entrances, exits and business are concerned. He is a
stickler for that. He may allow some of us to chew
our lines at rehearsal, but the business must be correct.
Merriwell has given him entire charge of the stage,
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he has chosen me to bully. That’s the size of
it, Miss Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no nonsense about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, look here, Mr. Hodge, I like you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you?” exclaimed Bart, in mingled eagerness and
doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I do, and I don’t want to see you make a
bad break. What are you going to do if you quit the
company?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, you do care. Don’t make a mistake. We
need you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I am not an actor—never was meant for one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You play the part you have been given.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Because it does not require acting. It is a part that
comes natural to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, there’s nobody to fill your place now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t be hard work to get somebody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid it will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, is that it!” muttered Bart, suddenly growing
fierce again. “You take such an interest in me because
you think it may be difficult to find somebody to fill my
place!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She laughed a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it is not that, my dear fellow—really it isn’t,
I told you I liked you, and it is true. I didn’t like you
much at first. I’ll confess that, but there’s something
about you that makes me take to you. I rather like
your way of getting hot under the collar when somebody
rubs you against the grain. I’m pretty independent myself,
but I don’t blaze up as you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, Miss Stanley,” said Hodge, seriously.
“I want to know something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you throwing a bluff when you say you like
me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you want me to stay with the company?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll stay on one condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must give me a promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What promise?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you will throw over Lester Vance and Billy
Wynne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stella Stanley was astonished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Throw them over?” she exclaimed. “What are you
talking about, my dear fellow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am talking what I mean,” breathed Hodge, hurriedly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“One thing you will acknowledge, Miss Stanley—I
have not been very forward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, not. You have always acted as a gentleman
toward me, Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not forced my presence. I have not flung myself
in your way?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” exclaimed Hodge. “I am going to tell you
something, Stella Stanley. I am something of a woman
hater, although I do not go round prating about it and
making myself offensive. I believe all women are treacherous—not
to be trusted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading lady laughed again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I must say you are frank, to speak the least!”
she exclaimed, showing her handsome, white teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am truthful,” asserted Bart. “Others might lie
about it; I tell you the simple truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And not so simple at that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have come to believe what I do about women
through what I have seen of them. They have disgusted
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stella stood smiling. She was two or three years
older than Bart, and inwardly she was thinking that he
was very young, indeed, to have and utter such opinions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear boy!” she exclaimed; “I’m sorry for you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t call me a boy!” panted Bart. “I don’t like
it. Don’t be sorry for me. I don’t like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what do you like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You, you, you!” he hoarsely whispered, leaning toward
her, so that she retreated a bit in sudden surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I thought you were a woman hater?” she said,
maliciously. “What is the matter with you? Why
aren’t you consistent?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t ask me to be consistent!” he exclaimed. “I
tried to hate you, like all the others. I tried not to pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>any attention to you. I tried to avoid you. I couldn’t
do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know whether to be flattered or offended.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be either, Miss Stanley. I am not trying to
flatter. I hope I shall not offend. I didn’t mean to say
this to you. Oh, I meant to keep my mouth shut, but
I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what ails lots of us,” she observed, with a
flippancy that jarred on his nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Despite myself, I would think of you when you were
not near. Despite myself, I would be watching you
when you were in sight. I saw you laughing and talking
with that addle-pated boy, Wynne, and I wanted to spank
him. I saw you smiling on Lester Vance, and I wanted
to knock his head off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And all the while I never dreamed of this. Oh, say,
Hodge, don’t get sentimental now. I don’t like it, my
boy. I didn’t stop you to have you tell me all this,
but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to tell it just the same!” he shouted, his
eyes blazing. “I did not mean to, but I’ll not be stopped
now. I am going to tell it, and, by Heaven, you must
listen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a pretty bad case with you, that’s plain; but
you’ll get over it, my dear fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Hodge ignored her words and manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have seen you walking with Vance,” he said. “You
went to church with him in Puleob. You have permitted
him to show you all kinds of attentions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve simply been polite to him, in return for his
kindness to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Polite! Kindness! I tell you I can’t stand it. That’s
what ailed me to-day. That’s why I would not obey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Havener. It has gnawed on me—gnawed, gnawed. I
have felt like kicking that fellow. Sometimes I have
found it hard to keep my hands off him. Stella—Miss
Stanley, you must quit him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really! Well, now, Hodge, you are going beyond
the limit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still he did not heed. He paid no attention to the
flush that rose to her cheeks. The words continued
to pour from his lips:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have said you liked me. Prove it! Now is
your chance! You want me to stay with the company.
I’ll stay if you throw both Vance and Wynne over—give
them the cold shoulder. I’ll stay for all of the call
down Havener gave me. I’ll swallow my pride and let
the matter drop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will be sensible of you, but you must not be
foolish about me, my boy—really you mustn’t. I am
older than you, and it is my place to give you advice.
You have lost your head, not your heart, my dear
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart’s hands clinched and unclosed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t talk to me that way!” came hoarsely from
his lips. “Don’t talk to me as if you regarded me as a
stripling! Answer me, Stella Stanley—will you drop
those fellows?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I couldn’t think of giving them the marble heart,
Hodge. It wouldn’t be right, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’ll go on laughing and chatting with them!
You will walk with Vance! You’ll eat at his table! Do
you think I can stay and stand that? No! Oh, you are
like all the others, and I hate you—hate you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He caught her in his arms and pressed his lips to
hers. She was startled by his sudden fierce action and
cried out.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man came springing forward.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“What’s this?” he cried. “Hands off, Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Vance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart straightened up, still with an arm about the
actress, who seemed to hesitate whether to laugh or
be angry. His eyes met those of Lester Vance, and
they were filled with the most deadly hatred. He did
not speak, but suddenly he stooped and kissed Stella
once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance sprang forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you insulting dog!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quickly Bart swung the woman behind him, and
squarely he met Vance. His arm shot out, his fist landed
with a crack and Vance lay stretched on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, without a word, with simply a look of unspeakable
scorn and contempt toward the fallen actor,
unmindful of the others of the company who came
rushing to the spot, Bart walked down the stairs and
out of the theater by way of the stage door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THROUGH THE TRANSOM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lester Vance got up. At first he was too dazed
to speak, but he recovered his tongue after a little and
began to swear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Merriwell came forward, saying sharply:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do, Mr. Vance! You know I do not permit
any such language on the stage or around the theater.
There are ladies present, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance put his hand over his eye and gave Merry an
ugly look. The other members of the company were
around, asking what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know your rules,” he admitted; “but that
cursed cur assaulted me—struck me in a treacherous
manner when I was not looking!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To whom are you referring in such a manner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He struck you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, the dirty, sneaking, miserable——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!” rang out Merry’s clear voice. “That will
do, sir! Bart Hodge is my friend, and I will not permit
you to apply such epithets to him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance showed his teeth, much after the manner of a
snarling dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I suppose you permit your friend to assault and
insult the ladies of this company?” he said, scornfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I know it; but Bart Hodge is not in the habit
of assaulting and insulting ladies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did so a few moments ago, the miserable whelp
of a——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Frank took a quick step toward the fellow, and Vance
stopped instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have warned you once,” said Merry, speaking in
a low tone. “I shall not speak again. Be careful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you stand up for him, Frank Merriwell, without
hearing what he has done!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am willing to hear what he has done, but you
must use proper language in relating it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Proper language! I don’t know how proper language
can be found to fit the occasion. I tell you your
friend of whom you boast has insulted one of the ladies
of the company!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That one!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance pointed at Stella Stanley, who, to his unspeakable
surprise, broke into laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank turned toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is this true, Miss Stanley?” he asked, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, it isn’t true!” she exclaimed. “Not a bit
of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” cried Vance, astounded, glaring at her.
“Surely, Stella, I saw the miserable fellow clutching
you in his arms. I heard you scream for help.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I heard that,” declared Granville Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I heard her scream,” said Agnes Kirk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So did I,” nodded Billy Wynne, “and I came running
to this spot as soon as I could. I saw Hodge strike
Vance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Others saw that,” said Lester. “There were plenty
of witnesses to his assault upon me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Methinks thou didst attempt to swipe him first,”
murmured Douglas Dunton, “else these faithful eyes
much deceived me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gol darned ef Vance warn’t tryin’ to dew somethin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>ter Hodge,” grinned Ephraim Gallup; “but he didn’t
seem ter do it very much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I simply attempted to protect Stella from his attack,”
asserted Lester. “I saw him seize her and kiss her in
the most violent and offensive manner, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stella interrupted him with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Offensive to whom?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To you, of course, for you struggled to throw him
off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, you saw that in your mind, Lester, my boy,”
she declared. “I did not struggle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance was astounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you—you screamed,” he fluttered, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I think I did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you do that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Hodge was a trifle abrupt, and he took me
by surprise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you acknowledge——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That—no more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it was an insult.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense! It was nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance was pale, and he began to glare at her, anger
and jealousy in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope, Miss Stanley,” he began, stiffly, “that you
are not going to say that you liked it? If you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is exactly what I am going to say,” laughed
the actress, to the surprise of all and the fury of Vance.
“I’d just been taunting him—having sport with him, you
know. He had his revenge by seizing me and kissing
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a most offensive and insolent manner,” sneered
Vance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Offensive to you, perhaps,” she commented, cheerfully;
“but not to me. As I said before, I rather liked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>it. I like a fellow who has the nerve to take things
by storm when he cannot get them otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She smiled on Vance in the most tantalizing manner
as she said this, and he well understood her meaning.
He ground his teeth with impotent rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you liked it so well,” he panted, “you should not
have screamed as you did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was an accident,” she declared. “Didn’t mean
to do it, you know, but it slipped out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” chuckled the youth from Vermont. “It
don’t seem to me that Bart done anything so very bad.
I think he was a purty gol-darn lucky feller!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly think Mr. Merriwell, who is so rigid in regard
to the deportment of the members of his company,
can approve of the behavior of some of them,” said
Vance, with something like a sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that Stella Stanley threw back her head and gave
him a withering look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it possible you mean me by that?” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so much as Hodge,” mumbled the jealous actor,
weakly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not so much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But some?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I was surprised to hear you confess that you
liked the treatment you received from that low fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you were!” came scornfully from the woman’s
lips. “I understand you, Mr. Vance, and I do not like
your language! Any insinuation against my character
I will not stand! I see I have been wrong in thinking
you a gentleman! I see I have made a mistake in permitting
you to pay me some attentions! Now you are
ready to presume on our friendliness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not that! You are——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>She cut him short with a gesture that might have been
given by a tragedy queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have said enough, Mr. Vance! You cannot
remedy it now. Let me tell you something—let me tell
you all something! Bart Hodge has acted as a gentleman
toward me. Anything that has happened that may
seem to contradict my statement I could account for—if
I chose. Let me say something more. I admire Bart
Hodge. He is young, but he doesn’t care for any living
thing, and that is something that I admire in any man.
When he is angry he looks as if he’d enjoy killing somebody,
and I admire him for that! If he started to do a
thing men or devils could not keep him from doing it,
and I admire him for that! When I attempted to have
sport with him, he seized me, held me, forcibly kissed
me—and I admire him for that! When some one attempted
to interfere in my behalf, he promptly knocked
that person down, and I admire him for that! There—I’ve
said my say. You know what I think of Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you admire him for acting like a cad on
the stage?” hissed Vance. “Havener must admire him,
too! Oh, he is a fine chap to admire!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stella looked at him and began to laugh again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear fellow,” she said, in a most provoking way,
“you had better attend to that eye without delay. It’s
turning black. It’ll be closed if you don’t look after
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she turned and walked away, leaving Vance almost
frothing with jealous fury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Granville Garland was almost the only man who remained
with Vance. The others moved away, talking
about what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got it in the neck, Vance,” said Garland, sympathetically.
“She has thrown you down for Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t talk to me!” growled the discomfited actor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“I could murder that fellow! I’d do anything to get
even with him, and I’ll find a way to do it, too!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, just now you had better take Stanley’s advice
and attend to that eye. You’ll be a beauty if you don’t
doctor it in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Snarling to himself, Lester Vance left the stage, and
a second later, fuming with fury, hurried from the theater.
At a market he bought a slice of beefsteak to use
as a poultice on his eye, and then hastened to the hotel
at which the company was stopping.</p>

<p class='c007'>Entering as unobtrusively as possible, he hurried up
to his room. Turning a corner of the corridor, he suddenly
halted, catching his breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short distance away, with his back toward Vance,
Hodge was unlocking the door of a room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why is he going in there?” thought the jealous
actor. “That is not his room. It’s Merriwell’s!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart opened the door and entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance stood irresolute in the corridor, wishing to do
something to injure Hodge, but undecided concerning
the course to pursue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has secured the key from the office and entered
Merriwell’s room,” muttered the actor. “I wonder what
he is up to. I’d give something if I knew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Softly he stole along the corridor till he reached the
door of the room. There he paused and listened. He
could hear Hodge moving about inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wish I might get a peep through the keyhole,”
thought Vance. “I believe he is up to something queer.
If I had time, I’d bring Merriwell here, so that he
might catch the fellow in there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked up at the transom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I could get a peep through that!” he mentally
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later he was tip-toeing along the corridor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>almost on the run. He had the key to his own room,
and he quickly and silently unlocked the door and entered.
Soon he came out, bearing a chair, and leaving
the door of his room standing wide open.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may want to get back there in a hurry,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaching Merriwell’s room, he placed the chair before
the door and quickly sprang upon it. Then, by standing
on his toes, he was able to look through the transom
glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>What he saw did not give him satisfaction just then,
for Bart was sitting at a little table, writing swiftly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pshaw!” thought Vance. “He’s writing a letter—that’s
all! He isn’t doing anything out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow was filled with disappointment. Still he
continued to stand on the chair and watch the youth
within the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a time Bart finished his writing. He took out
his watch and looked at it, muttering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must hurry if I want to catch that train.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance pricked up his ears. He knew nothing of the
quarrel between Merriwell and Hodge, if quarrel it
could be called, and still instinct told him that something
was wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonder why he’s going to catch a train?” he speculated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge had risen, leaving what he had written on the
table. He now picked up Frank Merriwell’s leather
grip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a good thing I know how to spring this lock,”
said Hodge, “else I’d not be able to get out of Atchison
unless I walked, and I’d do that before I would stay
here now. I have cut clear from everybody now, and
I’m going to go it alone in the future. If I go to the
dogs who cares!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The eyes of the spy beyond the transom began to glitter
and he was in a flutter of excitement. Now he was
certain that Hodge was up to something crooked, and
he eagerly awaited developments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart worked at the lock of the leather bag. It was
some time before he succeeded in opening it, but succeed
he did at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man outside the door rose on his tiptoes and
peered through the glass. In his excitement he nearly
lost his balance, but he recovered without falling with
a crash that would have alarmed the man he was watching.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance felt his heart fluttering and throbbing; it was
not easy for him to control his breathing, which now was
loud and hoarse. A sense of exultation was growing
in his bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So that is the chap Frank Merriwell trusts!” he
thought. “That is the friend in whom he has so much
confidence! Ha!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge was taking things out of the grip. He scarcely
looked at them as he dumped them out. He was eager
and in great haste.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance recognized the grip as being beyond a doubt
the one Merriwell always carried. He had observed
that Frank seemed to think a great deal of that plain
leather bag. He remembered hearing Merriwell say once
on a time that the grip was very valuable to him, even
though it might not be worth much to anybody else.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart did not seem to be looking for any particular
article in the grip, for he did not examine the things he
dumped out so carelessly. Evidently he was after something
that lay at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was it?</p>

<p class='c007'>The spy choked down his heart, which seemed rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>into his throat. The glitter in his eyes became exultant.
His lips were drawn back from his teeth, and they quivered
with a movement like the lips of a snarling dog that
is watching a hated enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything was out of the grip at last; it was empty.
The spy expected Hodge would begin sorting the articles
over in search of what he desired, but nothing of the kind
happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart picked up the leather bag, and then, with one
hand inside it and one outside, he made some singular
movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jove!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance almost shouted the word. Out from the grip
Hodge had taken a false bottom!</p>

<p class='c007'>The spy dropped down and listened. He was aware
that some sort of sound had issued from his lips in his
intense excitement, and he wondered if the youth within
the room had heard it.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some minutes, hearing nothing to warrant him
in believing he had alarmed Bart, the fellow arose again
on his toes and peered through the glass of the transom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge was taking something out of the grip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money!</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, money—paper money! There was no doubt of it.
In that grip, hidden by the false bottom, Merriwell carried
his money, and Hodge was removing it!</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the spy’s excitement was so great that he could
hear his own teeth chattering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve got him!” he thought. “I’ll settle him now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge partly turned toward the door, and Vance
ducked down, listening again. It was several moments
before he dared peer through the glass again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge had restored the false bottom to the grip, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>was putting back the various articles he had taken out in
the first place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s got the money!” exulted Vance. “He’s a thief!
This is Frank Merriwell’s trusted friend! Oh, but I have
him foul! I’d better skip, for he’ll be coming out
directly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance slipped down from the chair, and hurried toward
his room, taking the chair with him. Safely within
his room, he watched and waited till Hodge came out,
locked Merriwell’s door and hurried along the corridor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dodging out from his room, the spy sped the length
of the corridor. Reaching the turn, he peered cautiously
round.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door of Hodge’s room was standing open, and
Hodge was within.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not more than two minutes did Vance have to watch.
Hodge came out of his room, carrying his light overcoat
and a heavy valise. With these he descended the
stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By heavens! he is going,” muttered Vance. “He has
robbed Merriwell, and he is going to skip! What shall
I do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He thought of stopping Bart and having him arrested,
but quickly decided that was not the best course to pursue,
as he was not yet certain Bart had really committed
robbery. It was possible Hodge had given Merriwell
his money to keep, knowing it would be concealed in the
bottom of the grip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lester’s heart sank at that, for, if it were true, Hodge
was simply skipping the company, which was not such a
serious crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’ll be best to let him go,” Vance decided. “That
will queer him with everybody, and I shall have no more
trouble with him. If he has robbed Merriwell, so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the better. Oh, but it will be my turn to triumph now!
Somebody’ll hear from me! Stella shall acknowledge
that this slippery chap is not such a fine fellow after all.
Merriwell will not stand up so proudly and claim Bart
Hodge as his friend. Things have turned my way!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>BART’S WILD MOVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was nearly an hour later that Vance returned to
the theater, wearing a bandage over his eye, and having
his hat pulled well down to hide the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was decidedly nervous, and still there was something
of triumph in his manner. He did not seem to feel
the disgrace of his misfortune as keenly as it had been
fancied he would.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hang it all,” said Garland, finding an opportunity to
speak with Lester alone. “You actually act as if you
thought you had come off best in your encounter with
Hodge! What ails you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather think I’ll come off best in the end,” grinned
Lester, in a peculiarly knowing manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you do. I can see a peculiar under-meaning in
your manner. What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing that I know about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did not see Hodge after leaving the theater?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did? Where?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was he doing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Coming out of a room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What room?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What had he been doing in there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do I know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garland looked at Vance steadily for some moments.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“You know something you are not telling,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On my word, I do not!” protested Lester, in sudden
alarm. “What could I know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you are acting rather queer. Has Hodge been
up to anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Been up to anything?” repeated Bart’s enemy, as if
he did not understand. “What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, nothing! Let it drop. But I wonder why you
think you will come out best in the end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I think this Hodge is a rascal, and I believe
others will find it out. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t understand what there is to warrant such a
belief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I fancy I have read him pretty thoroughly. I
know just about how he is made up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid you are off your trolley. Hodge is not
popular in the company, but I’m inclined to believe he’s
on the level, for otherwise Frank Merriwell would not
have anything to do with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell may be fooled in the fellow, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not likely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have been friends a long time. I believe they
were schoolmates together. That is why Merriwell sticks
by Hodge as he does. He’s a chap who will never
turn his back on old friends, no matter what they may
do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance grinned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll bet the time will come when Frank Merriwell will
turn his back on Bart Hodge,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not understand what reason you have for thinking
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“I can’t. It’s a sort of feeling I have, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I wouldn’t advise you to bank much on that
feeling. It will fool you. You feel that way because you
hate Hodge. I don’t wonder you hate him, but, take my
advice and let him alone. He is a dangerous fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you for the advice. He isn’t half as dangerous
as you think, Garland. In fact, I regard him as
perfectly harmless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That eye doesn’t proclaim him to be. He must have
given you that in short order. There was a squall from
Stanley, and I rushed to see what had happened. Heard
a heavy fall, and you were picking yourself up when
I arrived on the scene, while Hodge was gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s it!” growled Vance. “He didn’t stay to face
me! He took to his heels, like the sneak he is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly think he ran away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care what you think; he did run away, just
the same, and I’ll bet he’ll take care not to meet me
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll have to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, he will. You are both in the same company,
and you have business with each other in the
play.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All the same, I don’t think Bart Hodge will dare
meet me again,” boasted Vance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garland turned away with an impatient gesture. He
did not like Hodge, but the seeming conceit of Vance
was too much for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance saw the look on Garland’s face, and it cut
him somewhat. He longed to tell Granville something
more and he opened his lips to do so, but prudence
bade him keep still, and so he did not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Hodge lacking, the rehearsal went on as well
as possible, special attention being given to the specialties.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Frank was restless and nervous. He longed to go in
search of Bart, for he fancied it was possible the hot-headed
fellow had cooled down enough to listen to reason.
He observed Vance was swaggering around in a
rather remarkable manner under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if he saw anything of Bart?” thought
Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry did not like Vance, but he resolved to question
him, and so he asked him if he had seen Hodge; doing
so quietly in order not to attract attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered Lester, speaking loudly, “I saw
Hodge at the hotel. He was coming out of your room,
too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Coming out of my room?” questioned Frank, lifting
his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not question the fellow any more concerning
Bart. Just then, Lester, who was looking down at
his left hand, as if examining his finger nail, gave a start,
exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s queer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is queer?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My ring is gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you left it somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I had it a while ago. I have been wearing it
next to my little finger, and I had a hard time to get it
on, so I put it on my little finger, although it was too
large.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When was that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just before rehearsal began.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it’s likely you have lost it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gracious! I’m afraid so, and I valued it highly.
It had my monogram set in fine stones, you know, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>it was a present to me. I wouldn’t lose it for any
amount of money!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may be around the stage somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few moments nearly everyone was searching
for Lester’s ring. Although they looked all around the
stage and in the dressing rooms, it was not found.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must have lost it after you left the theater,
Vance,” said Rufus Small.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I lost it on the street, I’ll never see it again,” said
Lester, dolefully. “It’s mighty tough!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where did you go from here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To a market, and then straight to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you lost it in the hotel. It may be in your
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance started and looked somewhat agitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so!” he cried. “I’ll look for it there if you’ll
let me go, Mr. Havener.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll all go,” said Havener. “We can’t do anything
more this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Needn’t hurry on my account,” said Vance, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>But rehearsing was over, and, not a little to Lester’s
uneasiness, Frank Merriwell left the theater at once and
hurried toward the hotel. Vance was unable to get ahead
of Merry without running, and this he did not do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presenting himself at the desk, Frank asked if Hodge
was in his room or around the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” answered the clerk, “he has left.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry caught his breath, a queer sensation striking
through his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Left?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t mean——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has settled his bill and departed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible!” cried Frank, in great consternation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The clerk lifted his eyebrows, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” said Merry, quickly. “I did not
mean to contradict your statement, but it does not seem
possible for me to believe it. Will you give me the
particulars?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are no particulars, save that he asked for
his bill, paid it, took the key to your room to get something
he said he had in there, came down very soon
with his grip and coat, and left.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a rare thing for Frank Merriwell to be dazed,
but he seemed so just then.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little distance away stood Lester Vance, a look
of intense satisfaction and triumph on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart has gone crazy!” thought Frank, his lips being
pressed together. “He’ll be sorry for this. Unless I
can stop him, there is no telling what may become of
him. I’ll not be likely to see him again for a long time,
and he is in such a reckless mood now that it will be
dangerous for him to go by himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took his key and went up to his room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must have a chance to think,” he decided. “I must
conclude what to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He closed the door of his room, and then he noticed
a sheet of paper, covered with writing, lying on the
table. Hastily he caught it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From Bart!” he breathed. “Wonder what this will
tell me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His eyes ran over the written lines hurriedly, and
this is what he read:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Frank</span>: It’s no use—I quit! I suppose you will
say it is a mean trick for me to leave you this way,
but I don’t care if you do! It’s my nature cropping out.
I think the devil is in me. I have taken all the money
I need, and it will be useless for you to attempt to follow
me up. You may as well let me go this time. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>take the money in place of my salary, which you have
not yet paid me. <span class='sc'>Hodge.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank stood there, staring at the paper—staring, staring.
The words ran together and danced before him.
Something was tugging at his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Hodge!” he murmured. “He cannot conquer
himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he crushed the paper and threw it on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll wager he didn’t take enough money to keep him
a week!” came hoarsely from Frank’s lips. “He should
have taken twenty-five dollars, at least, and it’s likely
he hasn’t taken more than ten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He picked up his grip and quickly emptied it upon
the bed. Then he soon removed the false bottom and
looked into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank stood there, as if turned to stone. On his face
was a look of mingled astonishment and pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone!” he finally said, his voice cold, hard and
metallic. “Every dollar gone—eight hundred and sixty
dollars in all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rat-tat-tat!—a knock on the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Frank could speak the door swung open, and
Granville Garland, Douglas Dunton and Lester Vance
entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell,” cried Vance, “Dunton has heard
something about Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has he?” said Frank, with perfect coolness, as if
nothing had happened to disturb him in the least.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have,” nodded Dunton, looking serious. “I heard
that he was seen purchasing a ticket for St. Joseph.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it true he has gone?” asked Garland. “I could
hardly believe it when Vance told me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid he has been foolish enough to leave,” admitted
Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“And all because Havener called him down! My, my!
How foolish! He oughtn’t to mind a little thing like
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was not all,” said Vance significantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remember what I told you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was that?” asked Frank, sharply, causing Lester
to start a bit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? Oh—oh—nothing much. Only—only——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance stiffened up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said Hodge would sneak,” he declared, attempting
to be bold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. He ran away after hitting me and I said he
would not stay to face me again. I knew he would
sneak.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remarkable!” exclaimed Frank, with a short laugh.
“So you think Hodge ran away to keep from meeting
you again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure of it. He is a coward!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Vance,” said Frank, “whatever else Bart Hodge
may be there is not a drop of cowardly blood in his
body. If you were a thousand instead of one he would
not have run away from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance colored.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think so,” he said; “but I don’t fancy you know
him very well for all that you have been acquainted with
him so long. I’ve never liked his looks. To me he
seemed to be a chap who would hesitate at no crime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance saw that Merry had been investigating the
grip, and he fancied his words would give the young
actor-playwright a start, but Frank’s nerve was unruffled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are we going to do?” demanded Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Yes, that’s the question,” said Dunton, anxiously.
“We can’t play without Hodge to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It strikes me that he has played you dirty, Mr. Merriwell,”
said Granville. “And he is the fellow with whom
you have been so friendly!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A nice friend!” muttered Vance, sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was sick at heart, but his calm face did not
betray the pain he felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is possible you do not understand how matters
stood,” he said. “I had no contract with Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t?” cried Dunton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really?” exclaimed Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s queer!” ejaculated Vance, in disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Frank, “I had no contract with him, and
so he has broken no pledge to me in leaving in this
manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still,” said Dunton, “there must have been some sort
of understanding between you, and Hodge was pretty
cheap to skip out without giving any sort of notice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not exactly the act of a friend of whom one can
be proud,” broke from Garland. “I think you’ll have to
acknowledge that, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was determined to defend Bart as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not know all that happened at the theater
to-day,” he said. “Hodge and I had some words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was galling for him to make that confession, but
he felt that something must be said to explain the sudden
desertion of Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garland whistled a bit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then that must have happened before the unpleasantness
between Hodge and Vance?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It did,” nodded Merry. “Hodge left me in anger.
He is hot-blooded and impulsive, and he did not stop
to reason about the matter. He has skipped out, it is evident,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>but I believe he will cool down and come back
when he comes to think it all over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he’ll be treating you dirty if he doesn’t come
back in time for the performance to-night,” said Garland.
“You would not be likely to take him back if
he returned to-morrow. I’m sure you wouldn’t take
back any of the rest of us if we served you such a
trick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t be sure of anything of the sort,” said
Frank, sharply. “You were not with the company
when Leslie Lawrence deserted and returned to beg pardon.
I did not fancy Lawrence, he was not a friend,
and yet I took him back. If Bart Hodge returns to-morrow,
I shall take him back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you can do as you like about that,” said Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you would take him back if he had stolen
your clothes from you?” asked Vance, jeeringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I chose to I certainly should,” answered Merry,
his eyes seeming to bore Bart’s enemy through.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hodge didn’t have much money yesterday,” said
Vance, staring at the open grip. “I wonder how he
happened to have enough to-day to settle his hotel bill
and purchase a ticket?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know he didn’t have money yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank shot the question at Vance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he—I—I heard him say so on the train.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Where do you suppose he got his money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I let him have it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance was disappointed and puzzled. He could not
understand why Merriwell did not denounce Hodge, for
he was certain Frank had discovered the money was
gone. Was it possible Merry intended to keep silent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and not charge Hodge with the robbery? Vance could
hardly believe such a thing possible. He could not
fathom the depths of such fidelity to a treacherous
friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this?” said Garland, stooping and picking up
the crumpled sheet of paper. “There’s writing upon
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Frank, as he quickly took it from the
man’s hand. “I threw it down there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Vance was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell is too proud to let us know,” he thought.
“He doesn’t want us to think he was fooled by Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I, for one, shall not feel very good toward
Hodge if he does come back,” admitted Dunton. “What
are we going to do, Mr. Merriwell? The town is billed
for the play, the day has arrived for the performance,
and there is a big advance sale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to lay off to-night,” answered Frank, as if
that settled it without further talk. “I will attend to
that. Don’t let it worry you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you get a man to fill Hodge’s place?” asked
Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I do not know yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what he was after in this room,” came
from Vance, in a last desperate effort to force Frank
to speak out. “He sneaked out of here as if he had
committed a crime. You haven’t lost anything, have you,
Mr. Merriwell? He didn’t take anything from you,
did he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t looked around yet,” was the cool answer.
“As for coming into this room, he had a right to do
that at any time. It was a privilege I gave him, and
it was always so understood by hotel clerks wherever
we stopped. I know you do not like Hodge, but take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>my advice, don’t try to make him appear worse than
he is. I don’t like it, and I won’t have it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank walked to the door and opened it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I beg you to excuse me. I
have business to look after, and time is valuable now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They took the hint and filed out. The door closed
after them. Vance wheeled about and looked toward
the door, his lips curling in scorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell is a fool!” he declared.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Shortly after the three actors departed, Ephraim Gallup
came bursting into Frank’s room, looking excited
and agitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gol-darn my pertaturs!” he spluttered. “Whut’s this
I hear abaout Hodge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” said Frank. “What do you hear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Skipped?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Thout notifyin’ yeou?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jee-roo-sa-lum!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gallup was stricken dumb for the moment. He stood
there, his mouth yawning and his eyes bulging, utterly incapable
of expressing his emotions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was packing some articles into his grip. He
seemed to be making arrangements to depart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jee-roo-sa-lum!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the Vermont youth uttered the exclamation. He
straightened up and cleared his throat. His mouth came
together, and he began to look angry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” he exploded. “That’s whut I call a darn
mean trick! I swan to man I never thought Hodge’d go
back on yeou, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry was silent, calmly continuing the packing of his
grip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ they’re sayin’ daown in the office that he swiped
somethin’ wut didn’t b’long to him,” said Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>That gave Frank a start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who says so?” he asked, his heart giving a leap and
seeming to drop back heavily, as if weighted down with
sudden dread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was it possible Bart had stolen something from the
hotel? Frank could not believe it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, some of the comp’ny.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a breath of relief that came from Merry’s lips,
and still the suspense was not fully removed. What if
Hodge had taken something belonging to some other
member? Under the circumstances, it would brand him
as a thief, even though actors frequently appropriated
articles belonging to others of the craft, without seeming
to regard it as stealing. In this case, nearly every member
of the company would be against Bart, and they would
magnify any little occurrence that might damage him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What were they saying?” asked Frank, with apparent
unconcern. “What do they claim Bart has taken?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They say Vance knows he tuck somethin’ frum yeou,
Frank.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, is that the yarn! Well, I wonder how Lester
Vance knows so much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would seem more manly for him to be silent about
Hodge under the circumstances. If he talks too much it
will look like a case of spite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was relieved, and still he wondered how Vance
could be certain enough to make such a charge against
Hodge. He soon decided that it must be no more than
suspicion on the part of Bart’s foe. Lester had seen Bart
leave Merry’s room, and he had decided that Hodge had
been in there for no honest purpose. That must be the
explanation of the accusation against the erring youth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Hodge didn’t take ennything of yeou, did he, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim threw the question fairly and squarely at
Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly Frank straightened up, giving the Vermont
youth a look that seemed full of resentment and indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you ask such a question, Ephraim Gallup!”
he cried. “I am astonished! Have you forgotten how
many times Bart has been unjustly accused of such
things? Have you forgotten how I have always stood by
him without ever once being mistaken? Do you think
Bart Hodge would stoop to do me a deliberate injury
now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim was abashed for a moment, and then he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, he’s doin’ yeou an injury by jumpin’ aout an’
leavin’ ye in this air kind of way, by thutter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He didn’t stop to think what he was doing. That’s
what’s the matter. If he had, wild horses could not have
dragged him away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mebbe so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know it, Ephraim—you know it! Hodge is passionate
and hot-headed. After his call down by Havener
to-day he came to me in my dressing room. We had some
words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great juniper!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hodge was unreasonable. I found it impossible to
talk the matter over with him properly. When I tried to
do so, he flew off the handle. For the first time since we
became chums I was unable to control him. His hot temper
had burned his reason out. He left the theater and
rushed here to the hotel. Without delay he packed up
and took a train out of town. If he had given himself
time to cool down he would not have thought of doing
such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like somethin’ they’re sayin’ about him naow.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is kainder looks ez if he run away to git rid of
meetin’ Vance ag’in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the worst kind of foolish talk,” he said.
“Hodge would not run from an army of fellows like Lester
Vance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t b’lieve he would, uther,” nodded Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Vance had such a fancy in his head he is fooling
himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I kainder think he b’lieves it hisself, by thutter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He doesn’t know the kind of material Bart Hodge is
built from.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whut yeou goin’ to do, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall attempt to follow Hodge and bring him back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No? Yeou don’t mean it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly I mean it. Do you think I am going to let
the poor fellow go to ruin? To-morrow he will be overwhelmed
with shame for his hasty act, but that very
shame will keep him from returning unless I find him and
bring him back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank,” said Ephraim, “yeou are the kaind of a
friend to hev! Yeou stick to yeour friends to the last
gasp. Be yeou goin’ right erway?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do yeou know where Bart’s gone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but I have a fancy that he has struck for St.
Joseph first. I shall try to trace him there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will yeou be back to-morrer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope to, but I am not coming back till I find Bart
Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But whut be we goin’ to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll make arrangements about that. I want you to
find Havener and send him here to this room without delay.
I have some instructions to give him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“All right,” said Ephraim. “I’ll hunt him up an’ tell
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hurried from the room. Outside the door he
paused a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” he muttered. “Was there ever another
feller that stuck to his friends same as Frank Merriwell
does? He’s true ez steel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener came up and found Merriwell all ready to
leave. The stage manager looked rather dejected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sorry about this business, Mr. Merriwell,” he said,
humbly. “I’m sure I didn’t think it would end this way.
If I had dreamed it would I should have permitted
Hodge to do just as he liked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And thus ruined the discipline of the entire company,”
said Frank. “You would have made a great mistake,
Havener.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he’s gone—he’s skipped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he has done it because I spoke to him on the
stage. I might have taken another opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Havener, when I made you stage manager of this
company I did so with the full intention that you should
manage the stage and the people on it. I made no reservations.
At rehearsal I am under you, and I thoroughly
understand that. It is the only way to run a company
as it should be run. A stage manager must have absolute
authority in his province, or he is of very little value.
I tried to tell this to Hodge, but he was too hot to listen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Hodge is your friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you always stand by your friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Always. At the same time I will not uphold a friend
to the absolute injury of somebody else. I will stand by
him and endeavor to convince him of his error, if he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>made one; but I will not aid him in injuring another
person.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener brightened and the downcast look left his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was afraid you would blame me in this matter,” he
said. “It’s pretty rough to be upset just like this, after
all the troubles you have had and just when there seemed
to be plain sailing ahead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not blame you at all, Havener. I have heard
just what took place on the stage, and I have no complaint
to make.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” said Havener, much relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have nothing to thank me for. I am going away.
I am going to make an attempt to overhaul Hodge and
bring him back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The performance to-night——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will not take place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The manager of the theater will be furious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t help that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will you do about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want you to attend to that matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will give me instructions?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are to notify the box office without delay that
sale of seats must stop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but there will be a flurry!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell the manager just what has happened. Here is
a check which I have made out for you. It is for five
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank handed Havener the check.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this for?” asked the stage manager.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To settle with the manager of the opera house and to
pay bills here till I return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener slowly shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid this won’t do,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Not enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a check on a Denver bank, and it’s for five hundred
dollars. I don’t think I can get it cashed in this
place, Mr. Merriwell. You have plenty of ready money.
You had better give me some of that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just a bit of color added its flush to Frank’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unfortunately, Mr. Havener,” he said, “I have not
plenty of ready money at the present time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but you told me on the train——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know what I told you. I said I was carrying several
hundred dollars with me so that I’d not get in a
tight corner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you told me so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have disposed of that money since coming to Atchison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener stared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Disposed of it?” he muttered as if he did not understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I have none of it handy now. For myself, I
have less than a hundred dollars, which I was carrying
on my person, but that will be enough for the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remarkable!” exclaimed Havener. And then, all at
once, a singular expression came over his face. “It isn’t
possible that what they are saying about Hodge is true?”
he exclaimed. “You don’t mean to admit that——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not mean to admit anything of the sort!” Merry
cut in, without waiting for him to finish. “Vance was
here with his unpleasant hints and suggestions. I will
make that check good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make it good?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“By getting the name of the hotel proprietor on the
back of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that Mr. Kent Carson, who knows the proprietor
of this house very well, has vouched for me here,
and the word of Kent Carson goes anywhere in Kansas or
Colorado.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that’s right, you are lucky. I believe I understand
why you are determined to follow Hodge up. I hope you
catch him, Mr. Merriwell. I didn’t think it of him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the kind of talk I do not like,” declared Frank,
sharply. “I have a favor to ask of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be glad to grant it, you may be sure of that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are to inform the company that I have left five
hundred dollars with you to keep things straight and as
a guarantee that I will return.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you are not to say that I left you a check for five
hundred dollars. You are to let them infer that I left the
cold cash. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are to permit no member of the company to see
you cash that check.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If anyone hints that there is anything queer about
this business you are to silence that person without delay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll do it, all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know what to do in relation to the theater here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what if you do not return in time for us to play
in Leavenworth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will cancel with Leavenworth by wire. No: if you
do not hear from me by ten o’clock to-morrow forenoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>you cancel. That will be better, for I might be where
I could not wire you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, but this is tough!” exclaimed Havener. “I
hoped there would not be any more of this kind of business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So did I,” nodded Frank; “but we can’t help it. It’s
pretty ragged, but we’ll have to swallow it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t understand how it is that you still hold a feeling
of friendliness toward a fellow who could put you
in such a bad box.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is because you do not understand Hodge and our
relations. If I let him go now without an attempt to
bring him back, I should regret it always.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a lucky fellow who wins such friendship as yours,”
said Havener, admiringly. “But I’m afraid Hodge
doesn’t deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like that kind of talk!” exclaimed Frank, with
a slight show of impatience. “I have upheld you in the
matter of the affair at rehearsal, but I don’t like to hear
you say anything against Hodge now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. Now we will go down and find the proprietor
of the hotel. I believe he will put his name to that
check. I’ll take my deposit book along, to show him that
I have a little something in the bank at Denver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They descended the stairs, Frank carrying his grip, but
leaving his handsome light overcoat behind. The proprietor
of the hotel was found, and in less than five minutes
Merry had talked him into putting his name on the
check, although he regretted doing so as soon as Frank
was gone.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>ON THE TRACK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An evening train bore Frank Merriwell into St. Joseph.
He had learned of a certainty that Hodge had purchased
a ticket and taken a train for that city, and he
hoped to find Bart there, although he feared he should not.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Bart kept on for Chicago, as he might do, there was
little chance of overtaking him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After starting, Frank began to realize that such a blind
pursuit seemed foolish in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c007'>His one hope was that Hodge would step off in St. Jo.
If Bart did not——</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not like to think of that. And still the conviction
that it was more than likely Hodge would continue
his flight grew stronger and stronger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” muttered Merry, as he stepped off the train,
“I’ll make a search for him here. It’s the best I can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had known all along that he might have stopped
Hodge by means of telegrams to the police departments
of various places through which the fugitive must pass;
but, even though Hodge had taken the money from the
grip, Frank’s soul revolted against recovering it by bringing
about the erring fellow’s arrest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already Bart was on the downward road—the road to
ruin! Frank felt certain of that. Was it possible to stop
him—to save him? It did not seem possible. It appeared
as if Bart’s downfall were complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the station Frank found a policeman and
asked a number of questions. Then he proceeded to a
hotel, where he registered and left his grip. He examined
the register, but Bart’s name was not there. He scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>expected to find it, for something told him Hodge would
not register under his own name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank believed he could recognize Bart’s handwriting
at a glance, no matter what the name might be, and it was
in this manner that he hoped to trace the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>He set out on a weary round of hotels, examining the
register at each one. He could not run over the list of
arrivals swiftly, for he knew it was possible Hodge might
attempt to disguise his handwriting, as well as assume a
fictitious name. This made him scrutinize each signature
closely and carefully. It was a tiresome task, but he
plodded on, hoping against hope. His nature revolted
against such crude detective work, but this did not seem
to be a case at which he could work in a systematic manner.
If he found Hodge it would be a case of good fortune
as much as anything else, and he knew it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he had visited all the hotels and his search had
been unrewarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no use!” he muttered, in disgust. “A detective
would laugh at me for trying to find a fugitive in such
a manner. Yes, he would laugh at me for thinking a
chap who had just stolen more than eight hundred dollars
would stop so soon after taking to flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, to me there seems two reasons why Hodge may
have stopped here. If he had not taken money he might
not have thought it necessary to get further away. If
he did take it, he may have thought it would be easier
to stop him by means of telegrams if he continued his
flight by train than it would if he dropped off here and
lost himself in this city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This reasoning did not give Merry much comfort. He
began to realize that he was hungry. He had not felt
the need of food before, so eager had he been to investigate
the hotel registers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Coming to what seemed like a respectable restaurant,
he went in and gave an order.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sat down near a table at which two men were eating.
He noticed that, although they made a display of
flashy jewelry, they were rather tough-looking chaps, decidedly
sporty in their dress. One of them had a thick
neck and close-cropped hair, while his face resembled
that of a bulldog. The other addressed him as “Mul,” or
“Muldoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It soon became evident that the other man’s name was
Rafferty. He had long, slim hands, with fingers that
squirmed in a snakish manner. His eyes were restless
and watchful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank had a theory that most men betray the profession
they follow by the language they use. While he
was waiting for his order to be served he unconsciously
listened to the talk of the two men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Muldoon,” said the fellow with the snaky fingers.
“I’ve taken your tip and shoved up a good wad on
the sucker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ yer all right, my boy,” asserted the owner of the
bulldog face. “Dat chap ain’t so much of a sucker as
some folks take him fer. Jest ’cause he comes from Chicago
dey gives him dat name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You feel sure he’ll brand the Maverick?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I? Well, say, ef I had a million I’d put it on dat.
If he ever lands dat left maul on Kansas Jim’s neck der
Maverick won’t know wot hit him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no cold deck in this game, is there? It’s to
be a square game with no holdout?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, want me ter tell yer somethin’?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Der Maverick’s up ag’in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dat’s straight.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“How do you know? Won’t he have a show?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll never do up Hanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then he’s playing against marked cards?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s dis way: It’ll be on der level jest as long as it
can be, but if dey see Jim’s gittin’ der woist of it—well,
he’ll be t’rowed down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dunno yit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know so much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m on der inside, I told yer. I can’t give erway der
boys wot puts me onter der game, but dey’ve tole me ter
tip me friends off ter lay their long green on der Sucker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Mul, I don’t forget this turn if the game does
run my way. I’ll see that you get a chance to go against
Tommy the Terror, just as I promised, if I rake in the
chips to-night. I don’t suppose there is any danger that
the police will interfere?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, dere was danger, but I rudder t’ink der cops has
been put off der scent. Dey dunno jest when der little
bout’s goin’ ter come off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they must have seen the sports coming into town
to-day. Lots of them have struck St. Jo. within the last
ten hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should guess yes! It’ll be a good t’ing fer der
club.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe there is any other city in the United
States where this sort of game could be played to a finish.
It’s to be a regular prize fight under pretension of having
a private sparring exhibition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dat’s wot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the way the sports have come into town should
be enough to tell the police that something more than
usual is to take place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw! der perlice here are dead slow! Den dey don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>care much, anyway. Was dere menny sports come on der
train wid you, Rafferty?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Several. One young fellow had got onto the fight
somehow, and he was dead crazy to see it, but didn’t
know how to get there. I think he had a roll to blow,
too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, why didn’t yer give him der tip if yer t’ought
he was on der level?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did. I sent him to Mike Kelley and told him Kelley
would get him in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank had decided that the fellow with the bulldog face
was a slugger and prize fighter, while his companion, the
owner of the squirming fingers, was a gambler. The
language of the men had revealed this plainly enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did yer give der young duck der word?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I told him to say ‘upper cut’ to Kelley and shove
out his fiver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was all right. Who was yer friend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t get his name. He was carrying a heavy grip,
with a long slip of paper pasted on the side of it. On the
paper were printed the words ‘True Blue,’ but I don’t
know what that meant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible for Frank Merriwell to repress a
start. He came near leaping to his feet with an exclamation
of satisfaction, but quickly closed his mouth and
dropped back into his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the track at last!” he mentally exulted. “That
young fellow who seemed to have a roll to blow and who
was so eager to see the prize fight was Bart Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Merriwell was on the alert now, his ears open
to catch every word of the conversation to which up to
that point he had listened with the idlest sort of interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank wondered why he had not thought of tracing
Bart by means of the strip pasted on Hodge’s grip. In a
moment, however, it seemed natural enough that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>not thought of such a thing, for it had not seemed probable
a fellow who had just stolen over eight hundred dollars
would travel around with a conspicuous label by
which he might be spotted and recognized. It was rather
remarkable that Hodge had not removed the words in
some manner from his traveling bag.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Hodge had acted as if he had a “roll to blow!”
In the midst of his feeling of satisfaction, Frank was
stricken by a sharp pain. He was glad to be on the track
of Bart, but the evidence of his former friend’s complete
depravity filled him with distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge had taken the money, and he was bound to
have a gay time while it lasted. At least, everything
seemed to indicate that.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry fancied that Bart had given up at last in his
attempt to be honest and upright. For a long time he had
struggled against his natural inclinations and against the
unjust suspicions of others. He had grown tired fighting
fate, for it had seemed that fate was determined that he
should go wrong. No one save Frank Merriwell had
shown absolute confidence in him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell had ever seemed to believe that Bart would
turn out well in the end, but now it appeared that his
faith had been sadly at fault and his confidence woefully
misplaced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank could understand how a proud, sensitive fellow
like Hodge could be driven to dishonesty by suspicion and
mistrust. But there was one thing Merry could not understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>How had Hodge smothered his conscience and his
sense of justice and gratitude enough to permit him to
rob the best and truest friend he had ever known?</p>

<p class='c007'>That was a puzzle to Frank. He did not like to think
of it. He could not bear to believe he had been entirely
wrong in his estimate of Bart’s character.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Somehow Frank had hoped in the face of all the evidence
of Bart’s culpability that it was not really true—that
Hodge had not taken the money.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now it seemed there could no longer be a doubt
of it. This gambler Rafferty had fallen in with Hodge,
and had given him a “tip” concerning the proper manner
to get to the prize fight that was to take place in St. Jo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge had seemed to have a roll and he was aiming
straight in the proper direction to get rid of it. Having
cut clear from Frank, it was plain he was seeking the low
and vicious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although a youth who could “handle his dukes” and
take care of himself in a fight, Frank Merriwell thought
very little of prize fights and prize fighters. He regarded
professional pugilism as brutal, and the “sports”
who followed it up and took delight in it as a low type
of humanity. It was his belief that such affairs should
be prevented by law, and the participants in them should
be severely punished by fines and imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not that Frank wished the encounters stopped for the
sake of the principals, but because he believed such spectacles
aroused the worst instincts in the witnesses of them
and tended to lower and degrade human beings who
saw them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank knew there was not a little that was cruel in
Bart Hodge, but he had suppressed this instinct in his
endeavor to model after Merry. He was one, however,
who would have no mercy on an enemy, should it happen
that that enemy fell into his power. And always had he
seemed to take great satisfaction in a square standing
fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry thought of his first battle with Hodge one moonlight
night in an old pasture at Fardale. That fight had
not been finished, but Frank recalled how like a fiend the
black-haired boy had struggled. Since that time he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>seen Bart in many encounters, and always Hodge had
fought with the same terrible fierceness, as if he was
burning with a desire to kill his antagonist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a fellow would take pleasure in witnessing a
bloody and brutal prize fight—a fight to a finish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somehow Frank’s sympathy for Hodge lessened. Had
Bart taken the money because he was in need of it, had
he taken it to pay debts, had he taken it with the hope of
going somewhere and starting in business for himself,
then Frank could have been more lenient. But for Hodge
to seem to hasten with the stolen money straight to the
companionship of “sports,” gamblers, prize fighters and
men of that order—it was too much!</p>

<p class='c007'>“These men must not get away,” thought Frank. “I
must follow them. I must find out where this fight is to
take place and I must get into it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The waiter brought his order.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I could find this man Kelley of whom they were
speaking,” thought Merry. “I know how to get there
through him. Five dollars and the password, ‘upper cut,’
would do the trick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to eat in haste, for he heard Muldoon remark:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’d better be hustling, Rafferty. Der game will
open at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be ready to go in a minute,” said the gambler.
“Here, waiter, what’s the check?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was very hungry, but he would have left his
food untouched rather than to lose sight of them then.
He bolted down a few mouthfuls and drank the cup of
coffee he had ordered.</p>

<p class='c007'>By that time Muldoon and Rafferty had risen and were
preparing to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank called the waiter the moment the two men
started for the door.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Check—quick!” he exclaimed. “Got to catch a train.
Didn’t know it was so late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The waiter gave him his check and he paid it in a
hurry, flinging down a quarter extra, and, grabbing his
hat, bolted for the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out on the street he was relieved to see Rafferty and
Muldoon a short distance away, walking rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank followed them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather think you will lead me straight to Hodge,”
he thought, exultantly. “If this was not a piece of luck!
And it came just when I seemed wholly off the scent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither of the men seemed to imagine they were followed,
and so Frank had no trouble in shadowing them.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the men turned into a side street. There it
was somewhat more difficult to keep track of them, but
Merry shadowed them without seeming to be doing anything
of the sort. He kept track of all their twists and
turns, unfamiliar with the city, though he was, and, at
last, he saw them enter a saloon by a side door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was not far behind them. He noticed that
others were flocking into that saloon by the same side
entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside, the saloon was packed. Men were smoking,
drinking, swearing and exchanging sporting talk. Most
of them were loudly dressed, and the saloon lights glinted
on many huge diamonds, of which there was a decidedly
vulgar display. A good number of the men were of the
thick-necked, beefy sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was such a saloon as Frank would regard as a “beer
joint,” but beer was not the beverage there that night.
It was either whisky, champagne, or nothing—and where
was the man who was taking nothing?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kansas Jim will win in a walk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on, you bluffer! He ain’t in it with the Sucker!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hanks won’t last three rounds.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“What have you got that says so besides your mouth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve got good horse sense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But no rino. Back your talk—back it up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s your money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here—right here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker flourished a “roll.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This talk did not seem to attract much attention, for
everybody seemed talking in a similar manner. One man
was pounding on the bar. He had a huge red nose and a
diamond in his shirt bosom that was as large as an acorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m Ned Carter of Kansas City!” he cried. “I reckon
you gents know me! If any of you has money to throw
away just back the Maverick. That steer will get
branded deep to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’m Col. McGraw of Topeka!” roared a tall man,
who wore a slouch hat thrust far back on his head, and
whose drooping mustache and long imperial were iron-gray.
“I don’t give a dern whether you gents know me
or not; but I’ll bet a cool thousand even that the Maverick
will put the Sucker to sleep inside of fifteen rounds if he’s
given a square deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s your long green?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Money talks!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Put up, colonel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or shut up, colonel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m here to back my talk,” declared the Topeka
man, fishing into an inside pocket. “Here’s the—— Well,
I’m blowed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve been touched! Gents, I’ve been robbed of five
thousand dollars I took to back the Maverick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha! ha!” roared the crowd. “Colonel, it won’t
go! You are a squealer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>To this the Topeka man roared a vigorous protest, but
his words were drowned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Frank’s breath was almost taken away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, this beats!” he gasped. “It must be the police
of this city are dead slow, or else they are standing in
with the parties who are running this fight. If they were
not, they’d be dead certain to catch on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked around for Rafferty and Muldoon, but
could see nothing of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m certain they came in here,” he muttered. “They
must be somewhere in this crowd.” He moved about to
find them, being obliged to crowd his way about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi, there, young feller! ye’re treadin’ on my toes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” said Frank, as politely as he
could.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, ye’d better!” growled the big man, glaring at
him. “What’re you in here fer, anyhow? Ye’re nothin’
but a boy. This ain’t no place fer you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank attempted to move away, but the arm of the man
shot out, and Merry was collared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You go home to your mammy, youngster,” advised
the fellow, starting to drag Frank to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Toss him out, McGinty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give him the bounce, slugger!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spank the mother’s boy and send him home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does his mother know he’s out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The door was reached, and the big fellow started to
swing Frank round to get a better hold of him. At that
moment Merry broke away with a sudden twist and yank,
caught the surprised ruffian behind, gave him a strong
shove, and planted his foot with all his strength under the
tail of the man’s coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>McGinty, the slugger, was fairly lifted by that kick and
sent spinning through the swinging doors, which opened
before him and closed behind him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Great ginger!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Holy smoke!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did yer see that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s dr’amin’ Oi am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The young feller kicked the slugger out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what he did!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it’s the first time anything like that ever happened
to the slugger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“McGinty’ll come back for his gore!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young chap, you’d better skip out by the other door,
or he’ll kill you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” said Frank, quietly, his eyes flashing.
“I am minding my business, and I shall not run away
from that tough. If he bothers me again I’ll kick him so
hard he won’t be able to walk for a week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the stuff!” roared Col. McGraw of Topeka.
“The boy is all right! He’s no baby, and anybody who
thinks he is makes a mistake. What’ll you have, young
man? If I have been touched, I’ve got enough red money
left to buy the drinks, and you can have anything you
want.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never drink, sir,” answered Frank, calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wh-wh-what?” exploded the colonel. “Never drink?—and
you kicked McGinty? Oh, say——”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Frank could not be induced to drink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think of that, Kelley?” asked the Topeka
man, in apparent disdain, addressing one of the barkeepers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>The man spoken to seemed so busy that he paid no
attention to the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kelley! Kelley!” Frank mentally exclaimed, taking
good note of the man who had been called that. “This
must be the Kelley Rafferty directed Hodge to see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He felt that the scent was growing hot.</p>

<p class='c007'>McGinty did not return, and two or three men went out
to see what had become of him. They came back carrying
the man Frank had kicked through the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s done,” one of them said. “Found him lying outside,
and he said he couldn’t get up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, why in blazes did you bring him in here?”
shouted one of the barkeepers. “Take him into the back
room, now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As McGinty was carried along he saw Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, young fellow,” he feebly asked, “do your legs
run by steam? I was kicked by a mule once, but that
wasn’t a patch to this!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they bore him into the back room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much to his dismay, Frank found that this little incident
had sufficed to draw attention to him. Again and
again he was urged to drink. At length, in order to get
up to the bar and find a chance to speak to Kelley, he consented
to take a plain seltzer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached the end of the bar and Kelley served him.
As he did so, Frank thrust a five-dollar bill over the bar,
saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Upper cut.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No good,” answered Kelley, shoving it back, to
Frank’s dismay. “All gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Mr. Rafferty said——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rafferty? Are you one of his?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he told me——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Then you’ve got the last one there is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill was taken, and a piece of pasteboard was
tossed at Merry, who caught it deftly.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the pasteboard it said:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Union Athletic Club</span>.</div>
    <div><span class='small'>Sparring Exhibition.</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>Admit Bearer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was no date upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is this good for to-night?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” nodded Kelley. “If you ain’t drinking anything
but seltzer you’d better be getting in so that you’ll
have a chance as near the ropes as you can get.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going in now,” said a man. “You can come
along with me, young fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank gladly availed himself of the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if this isn’t luck!” he thought. “I am bound
to get there now, and I think I’ll be sure to find Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He followed the man through a swinging door, and
they passed along a dark wall till they came to another
door. Then they ascended a flight of stairs, turned to
the right, seemed to enter another building, traveled another
passage, ascended more stairs, and came to a door
where their tickets were taken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long before the go?” asked the man with Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not long,” was the doorkeeper’s response. “Fifteen
or twenty minutes, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were admitted, and Frank soon found himself in
quite a large room, with something like a pit in the center.
In this pit was a raised platform, which was surrounded
by ropes. All around this platform were rows of seats,
rising tier on tier, as they do in a theater.</p>

<p class='c007'>From at least six different entrances people were
streaming into that room, and already a great crowd occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the seats. Men were smoking everywhere, but a
huge fan ventilator seemed to carry off most of the smoke
and keep the air fairly clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank wondered if Hodge was there. He began to
look around for Bart at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on,” urged his companion. “We must get as
good a place to see as possible. Let’s get down in front.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Frank was not so eager to get down toward the
front, for he wished to be where he could overlook the
crowd of spectators. He permitted the man to go ahead,
but lingered behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was wonderful how swiftly those seats filled up. It
was not long after Merry entered before every seat
seemed taken and many were standing. Betting talk was
being made on all sides. The odds seemed in favor of the
“Sucker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still Frank could see nothing of Hodge, and it seemed
that he had surveyed the face of every person present.
He began to fear that Hodge was not present and would
not appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he ever dreams I have followed him he will stay
away from here—he’ll get out of St. Jo.,” thought Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the seats were taken, still the spectators came
pouring in.</p>

<p class='c007'>A loud-voiced fellow appeared and made an announcement.
He delivered quite a speech, explaining how the
referee had been chosen, and finally introduced the
referee, who followed with a speech of his own, in which
he boasted so much of his squareness that Frank decided
he must be a great rascal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there was a howl from the assembled crowd:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There comes the Maverick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Swathed in a blanket, one of the principals entered the
roped arena, accompanied by his second. The crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>thundered its applause, and he bowed his bullet head several
times in acknowledgment, finally sitting down in a
corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came the other fighter, also wrapped about by a
blanket, and the audience howled still more hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank paid very little attention to this. He scarcely
noted what followed. Finally he heard the clang of a
gong, and then he knew the fighters were at it. He
glanced toward the “squared circle” and saw them sparring,
lunging, dashing, retreating and dancing about each
other, but his heart was sinking more and more as he
failed to see anything of the one person he sought.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then, right in the midst of the very first round,
came a startling cry:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The police! the police!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re raided!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a hammering at the doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that very instant Frank Merriwell’s eyes rested on
the face of the one he sought. There he was, almost directly
opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart!” he shouted—“Bart Hodge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge must have heard the cry, for he looked across
and his eyes found Frank’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment later Hodge was swept out of sight by the
stampeding crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank felt himself lifted, carried, whirled about, borne
onward despite himself. He struggled to run back, to
force his way toward the spot where he had seen Hodge.
It was useless.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bang! bang! bang!—the police were hammering at the
heavy doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crash!—a door fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The police rushed in and the lights went out!</p>

<p class='c007'>How it happened Frank Merriwell was unable to tell,
but in the darkness he was swept along through a doorway,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>down a flight of stairs, carried onward again by
the rushing men, to finally stumble down another flight
and grope his way out into the street by a basement door.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had escaped arrest, but had lost Hodge. He found
his way back to the saloon where he had purchased the
ticket, but that was in the hands of the police.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently the officers of St. Jo. were not so slow, after
all. They had made a goodly haul, and patrol wagons
were bearing the prisoners away by the twenties.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll bet anything Hodge was nabbed!” thought Merry.
“If so, that will be all the better, for I’ll be able to reach
him when he is arraigned in court to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Till midnight he remained up trying to find something
of Hodge, and then he sought his hotel, more than satisfied
that Bart had been captured by the police.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of his exciting adventure, Frank slept well
after retiring to bed. He had a way of relaxing his
nerves and throwing off all worry and care, enabling him
to sleep under the most trying circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning Merry arose much refreshed, even
though he had retired late. The theatrical business had
accustomed him to late hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>He ate a good breakfast, and was on hand when court
opened. He saw the prisoners arraigned, and, to his unspeakable
disappointment, Bart Hodge was not among
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Hodge is here in St. Jo.,” thought Frank. “That
is, he is here unless, after seeing me last night, he took
alarm and fled. It’s probable he may have done that.
It was foolish for me to shout to him just as the police
were breaking in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was useless, however, to regret this action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank went to Kelley’s barroom. The place was wide
open and doing business, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Merry inquired about Hodge, and, after a time, Kelley
seemed to remember Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dark-faced chap,” said Kelley. “Rafferty sent him
here, same as he did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” nodded Frank, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You want to find him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno how you will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give twenty-five dollars to find him!” cried Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>A man who had been listening stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean that, young feller?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do!” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you give me that to tell you where to find him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. I know the fellow you mean. He said he
had a lot of money, or he made some of Mike Roper’s
gang believe he had. But the gang got left on him, for
they didn’t find enough on him to pay them for doping
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then Hodge has fallen in with a tough crowd?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s the only one to blame for it. They’d let him
alone if he hadn’t put up such a bluff about having a lot
of money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he didn’t have any?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Frosty Ike said he didn’t have enough to buy
drinks for the crowd all round.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take me to him. You shall have the money I said I
would give.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank followed the man from the saloon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, look here,” said the stranger, who was rather
disreputable in appearance, “you’ve got to promise not to
blow to a living soul that I put you onto this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll agree to that,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’ve got to agree not to pull me into court
over it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“If you are pulled into court it will be well worth your
while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man stopped, irresolutely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t reckon I’ll go along with ye,” he said. “I
can’t afford to get Frosty Ike down on me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s Frosty Ike?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The worst man in St. Jo. He eats railroad iron when
he’s hungry! I wouldn’t make him a bite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If you lead me to
my friend you shall have the twenty-five dollars. If it is
true that this Frosty Ike and his gang have not robbed
my friend there will be no danger of your getting into
court. If they have robbed him I’ll give you a hundred
dollars to testify against them, in case I think it best to
prosecute. I may not prosecute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will have to agree not to prosecute before I’ll go
any further. I wouldn’t get mixed up with Ike for two
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was not long deciding. He realized that he
could not prosecute Frosty Ike’s gang without having all
the facts come out concerning the manner in which Hodge
obtained the money, and he concluded to give the man the
desired pledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was led to a low quarter of the city near the river.
Down among a lot of storehouses they went, and entered
one of the old buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s in here somewhere,” said Merry’s companion.
“We’ll have to hunt for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was on guard for a trap, for it seemed quite
possible he had been led into a snare. The search began.
From room to room they went. At last they came to a
wretched room, filled with old boxes and barrels. Frank
was in advance. He entered the room, and there lay
Hodge on the floor, drugged or—drunk!</p>

<p class='c007'>It was hours later that Bart came to himself in a respectable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>room of a hotel. He opened his eyes, and they
rested on Frank Merriwell, who was sitting there, watching
and waiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart did not speak. He lay there, wondering where
he was and if he had been dreaming.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a little, Frank moved nearer the bed, smiling in
his old, pleasant way, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, old man, I expect you feel pretty rocky?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still Hodge did not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The doctor said he thought you’d come round all
right in a short time,” observed Merry. “He hasn’t been
gone long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, old man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have I been ill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you were about as ill as knockout drops could
make you without doing you serious damage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Knockout drops! Then it was no dream! Then I
did talk like a fool to you in Atchison and run away!
Then I did resolve to go straight to the devil in a hurry
and try to make a start on the road! Then I really saw
you at the prize fight just as the police broke in! Then I
really did get in with a gang after that and drink with
them! I have betrayed you, Frank! I ran away from
you, like a miserable sneak! I felt I was doing a mean
thing after I had started, but it was too late then!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is never too late to mend, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A fool said that! In my case, it is too late!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still he had said nothing of taking the money. Frank
wondered at that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What made you follow me, Frank?” said Bart. “Why
didn’t you let me go? You have bothered with me
enough. There is no reason why you should do so any
more. You must despise me now. Why did you follow
me?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“I thought I might overtake you in time to save you,
but you fell into the hands of those toughs, and they
stripped you. You did not have coat, hat, watch or
money when I found you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They didn’t get much money,” said Bart, “for I didn’t
have much. My watch was valuable, of course, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What became of the money you had?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I didn’t have much,” said Bart, “though I put
up a bluff with the sports that I did. I took only twenty
dollars, you know, and I left the note telling you I had
taken that. I thought that was not too much for my
work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank sat still some seconds, staring at Bart. Then he
rose to his feet, and the look on his face caused Hodge to
rise to his elbow and cry:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it? What is the matter, Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart,” said Frank, slowly, “every dollar I had in that
grip was gone when I looked for it after your departure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That brought Hodge out of bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone?” he gasped, in horror. “Gone? Why, how
could that be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank—Frank, you don’t think I took that money?
My God! you don’t think I took it? I have fallen pretty
low, but you don’t think I would rob you—you who have
been the only true friend I had in all the world? Why,
Merry, I’d starve—I’d suffer the tortures of hell before
I’d do such a thing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not doubt him then; he felt in his heart that
Bart spoke the truth. And Merry’s heart leaped with
joy and triumph. Hodge was not guilty!</p>

<p class='c007'>Who was?</p>

<p class='c007'>But Bart was completely “broken up” by what he had
heard. Never had Frank seen him look so overcome by
horror.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Merry, Merry!” he gasped, “did you think I had
stolen your money? Was that why you followed me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” cried Frank. “That was not why I followed
you, Hodge. I followed because I hoped to overtake
you and bring you back—because I wished to save you
from the consequences of your folly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you thought I had taken the money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hoped not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, you thought I had! Oh, heavens! Frank,
Frank, this is enough to break a fellow’s heart!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He dropped down on the bed, burying his face in his
hands and shaking all over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank’s distress was great, but it was mingled with a
feeling of triumph.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart,” he said, speaking swiftly, “I could not account
for the loss of the money. It was gone, and on the little
table was your note, in which you said you had taken
enough to meet your needs. What was I to think? It
was your handwriting—I knew that. How could I account
for the disappearance of the money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you account for it now?” groaned Hodge.
“Frank, are you sure it was gone—are you sure you made
no mistake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t seem possible!” panted Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he caught sight of Frank’s grip, sprang for it,
caught it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Open it, Frank!” he cried—“open it and let me see!
I shall not be satisfied till I look!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is no use,” said Merry. “The money is gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Open it!” Hodge shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did so. Bart tore out the contents. He sprang
the fastening that held the false bottom in and removed
the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, gone!” he groaned, thrusting in his hand and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>feeling about. “But as there is a God, I swear I did not
take it! Do you believe me, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Bart, I believe you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“More than that, I never did believe that you took it.
My doubts caused me to keep silent when I made the discovery.
Not a single person knows I lost the money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you kept silent—for my sake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, Frank, again you have shown yourself the noblest
fellow in the whole wide world. But I was not worth it!
Oh, I am so ashamed of myself! I am such a mean, degraded
creature!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are nothing of the sort, Bart. You are too quick
and passionate, and you have made a false step, but there
is plenty of time to turn back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never rest till I bring the real robber to justice!”
vowed Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he gave a sudden cry:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took something out of the grip—a ring!</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank snatched it from Bart’s fingers and looked at it.
Then, with remarkable coolness and a feeling of unspeakable
satisfaction, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the evidence that will convict the real robber!
Look at the monogram on that ring—‘L. V.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘L. V.’ Why, that stands for——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lester Vance!”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>Frank and Bart returned to Atchison. Of course
Merry provided Hodge with a coat and hat. Fortunately,
Bart had left his overcoat at a lodging house where he
had stopped, so that was not stolen from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as possible Merriwell summoned Lester Vance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to his room. Vance came in, looking rather uneasy.
Hodge was there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Vance,” said Frank, “have you found your ring
which you lost yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I have not,” confessed Lester.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Under the false bottom in my grip, where I used to
keep my money!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lester was thunderstruck. He turned deathly white
and trembled all over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vance,” said Merriwell, his eyes seeming to flash fire,
“you can save yourself from disgrace, exposure and imprisonment
by returning every dollar of that money.
Otherwise, you go to prison!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance broke down immediately and confessed. He
told how he had slipped down to the office after Hodge
and obtained the key to Frank’s room when the clerk was
not looking, and how he had been able to take the false
bottom out of the grip and secure the money. He restored
the whole of it, and left the company suddenly and
mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The various members of the company, with the exception
of Frank and Bart, believed Vance had departed
thus hurriedly because of Hodge’s return.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not betray Vance, and he caused Hodge to
keep silent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s getting too thin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The way mash letters are coming in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Hodge smiled faintly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say it was getting too thick, Frank,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank looked at Bart quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are coming all right!” he exclaimed, with satisfaction.
“When you can even crack a ghost of a joke
like that it is a sign that you are getting to be yourself
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haw!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim Gallup uttered the exclamation. He was sitting
near the window of the room looking out into one
of the principal streets of St. Joseph.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, what is the matter with you, Ephraim?” Merry
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“B’gosh! I thought yeou hed more sense!” drawled
the Vermonter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sense? How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then ter think Hodge is gittin’ like hisself ’cause he
tried to crack a joke. It kainder seems ter me he’s gittin’
off his trolley. Did yeou ever hear him crack a joke when
he was all right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t know—I don’t remember about it,” confessed
Frank, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Course ye don’t. I think it’s a mighty bad sign when
Bart Hodge tries ter joke. He must be sick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge said nothing. He was sitting astride a chair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>with his arms resting on the back and his chin resting on
his arms. He looked at Ephraim grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was sitting by a table, opening the mail Ephraim
had just brought to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True Blue” was playing a two nights engagement in St.
Joseph, having opened the previous night at the Crawford
Theater. The house had been packed, and the rattling
college play went with a vim that electrified the
audience and created a sensation. The manager of the
theater had been delighted, and he lost no time in asking
for a return date, which, however, Merry was unable to
give him, on account of the lateness of the season and
the route already booked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately, Merriwell had been able to find a man to
fill the place of Lester Vance, who had been “released”
so abruptly in Atchison.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Merry’s surprise the night before, the opening night,
several handsome bouquets of flowers had been handed
to him over the footlights, and one had been thrown at
his feet from a box. He saw the person who threw the
flowers, in acknowledgment of which he had bowed a
bit and smiled, and he observed that she was a decidedly
handsome young woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his further surprise, he afterward discovered a slip
of paper attached to the bouquet, and on the paper were
written Portia’s words, “If you do love me, you will find
me out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank had looked on this as something of a joke, but
now, on receiving his morning mail, he was astonished to
find in it no less than four “mash notes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s evident you have made a hit with the fair sex in
this city, Merry,” said Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He does that ev’rywhere, by gum!” grinned Ephraim;
“but they don’t seem quite so forrud in some places.
I ruther guess he hit ’em harder than usual here.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Here’s one that is a prize!” exclaimed Merry. “Poor
girl! She should take a course at a good grammar
school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He handed the note over to Bart. This is what Hodge
read:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grammar school!” exclaimed Hodge, as he passed the
note on to Ephraim. “She should attend the primary!
What a fool she must be!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I dunno!” grunted Ephraim. “She says Frank
is all right. There ain’t northin’ foolish abaout that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is likely the poor girl has had no opportunities,”
said Merry. “I am sorry for her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out!” warned Hodge. “If you get up a feeling
of sympathy for all the females who write you mash notes
you’ll be in hot water. Every popular young actor has to
dodge girls who want to steal him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By thutter! I’ve notissed some of this comp’ny don’t
do mutch dodgin’,” grinned Gallup.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, they have mashes in ev’ry place they go to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they do not bother with the girls who get mashed
on them?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Don’t they!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess yes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve got eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank frowned a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not like to carry round men who will give my
company the reputation of being a lot of mashers,” he
said, soberly. “Of course there is such a thing as a
‘harmless flirtation,’ but the girl who flirts with a strange
actor is very foolish. She is playing with fire, and there
is great danger that she will be burned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you can’t stop it,” said Hodge. “I haven’t been
on the road very long, but I have found out that girls
everywhere are ready to make fools of themselves over
any old thing that is an actor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you haven’t been flirting with them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather think not! You know well enough, Merriwell,
that I do not take any stock in girls. All the same,
I’ve never been in a place yet where I could not have
made the acquaintance of girls. Mind, I say girls—not
a girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s remarkable that intelligent girls should be so foolish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Foolish is the word for it, Merriwell. And surely
most of the girls seem intelligent enough. Some of them
are very pretty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And those bright and pretty girls are willing to become
acquainted without an introduction with actors of
whom they know absolutely nothing! Strange.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” broke in Ephraim. “It does seem that
they’ll take any old thing they kin git ef it is an actor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank shook his head, looking very grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do they know but they are flirting with married
men?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Some of um don’t seem to keer a rap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those must be bad girls, don’t you think, Ephraim?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno. Some of um don’t seem so bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I asked that question to see what you thought about
it. I, myself, do not fancy they are bad—all of them.
It is simply a case of folly. There is a certain glamour
about an actor that robes him with false attractions for
light-headed young girls. It makes the most commonplace
fellows seem like heroes. No. I do not think all girls
who flirt with actors are bad, but I do think they are foolish.
It is quite likely they would turn in scorn and repugnance
from the very fellows who seem so much like
heroes to them could they know the truth about those
same heroes. When a theatrical company comes into a
place, the girls will turn in many cases from the respectable,
honest young men whom they know, and smile and
flirt with the members of the company, who are utter
strangers to them. In this manner they often acquire undesirable
reputations without going to the extreme of doing
anything seriously bad. But when a girl injures her
reputation in such a manner it is pretty hard for her to
win back the ground she has lost. She is regarded with
suspicion, she has become a theme of gossip and perhaps
she is startled to find that the young men she knows, who
have always been polite and respectful, have suddenly
grown familiar and forward in their manners toward her.
She does not understand this, but she is entirely to blame
for it. It is but natural for a young man to think there
is something wrong about a girl who will flirt with a
strange actor. It is but natural for him to lose in a certain
measure his respect for such a girl and become free
and easy in his treatment of her. He sees no reason why
he cannot be that way if she will laugh and talk with an
actor—a man of whom she knows absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“It’s plain enough you have thought about this matter,
Frank,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have,” declared Merry. “Since going on the road I
have thought of it a great deal, for you must know that
I have seen how easy it is for a traveling showman to
make the acquaintance of pretty girls wherever he goes.
I don’t know that I have ever expressed myself on the
subject before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yeou ain’t much of a hand to talk abaout gals,” said
Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I do not like to say anything about them unless
I can say something pleasant. I think girls are the fairest
creatures in all the world, but they have their faults, the
same as other fair things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge smiled sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re all faults!” he declared. “I have grown disgusted
with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’re a pessimist!” said Frank. “You are too
extreme. But I really wish there was some way to warn
the young girls of the country against the folly of flirting
with traveling actors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid not. They will continue to flirt, as they
have in the past, and no end of sorrow and shame will
come from it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some gals do it,” said Ephraim, “because they think
they kin hev some fun that way without goin’ too fur.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the first false step is taken no human being can
tell where it may lead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge nodded. In his heart he knew Frank Merriwell
spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any girl must know she will be seen by people who
know her in case she flirts with a strange actor,” Frank
continued. “What does she suppose will be thought of
her! If she does not think enough of herself to refrain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>from such dangerous amusement, she should pause to consider
what others may think of her. The story will pass
from mouth to mouth; it may be elaborated. Perhaps she
has passed in good society in her home. Of a sudden she
notices that some of her former girl friends are a trifle
frigid toward her. Then it is possible some little social
event takes place and she received no invitation. She
feels hurt and mortified. She may not suspect the truth,
and so she goes on doing the very things that have led to
her unpleasant situation. Or she may suspect it and say,
in anger, that she has done nothing wrong, and so in
absolute defiance keeps on as she has begun. In both
cases she finds herself dropped from her social circle, and
she is forced to seek friends elsewhere. She feels this
keenly, but it may make her all the more desperate and defiant,
so that she carries her flirtations with strangers further
than she otherwise would. In her anger and desperation
she may grow very reckless, which may lead to her
utter shame and disgrace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darn it, Frank!” cried Ephraim, “ef the gals could
hear yeou talk, I ruther guess they’d be keerful. But they
can’t hear ye, so haow be yeou goin’ to do um any good?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have thought of writing a play about it, or a book.
If I wrote a book, it should be a novel and its title should
be, ‘Harmless Flirting.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would waste your time, Merriwell,” said Hodge.
“Your book would not be read by the ones for whom you
wrote it. Such light-headed girls seldom read anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid you are right,” confessed Merry. “I am
afraid girls will go on flirting with actors and strangers
to their own sorrow and remorse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank picked up one of the letters from the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now here is something from a girl for whom I am
sorry,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>He read it aloud:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Merriwell</span>: I suppose you will think
me very foolish to write to you, but I saw you in your
beautiful play ‘True Blue,’ last night, and I was perfectly
charmed. It is a lovely play, and you act the part
of <i>Dick Trueheart</i> in a just perfectly splendid manner.
My brother Tommy says you are a real Yale college man,
and that you are just a peach. Tommy is fourteen. I
am sixteen, but I’m real large for my age, so almost
everybody thinks I am eighteen. I am going to see you
again to-night. I wish I knew you. I think you must
be awfully nice. I think actors are lovely, but papa says
they are no good. He is a cross old patch. My mother is
dead. I hope to go on the stage sometime and become
a great actress, and wear diamonds and have flowers
passed me over the footlights. I inclose a knot of blue
and white ribbon. If you will wear it on your baseball
uniform to-night I shall know you would like to become
acquainted with me, and I will find a way to let you know
my address before you leave St. Joseph. Oh, I do hope
you will wear it! From your sincere admirer,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, by gum! she’s hit hard!” grinned Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s another little fool!” sneered Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I am sorry for Dora,” declared Frank. “Her
little head is full of false notions, and she is very liable to
make a big mistake on that very account. I wish I might
warn Dora.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can by wearing that knot of ribbon and becoming
acquainted with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the very thing I will not do. I do not believe
in becoming acquainted in such a manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then yeou ain’t goin’ to wear the ribbon?” asked
Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“B’gosh! yeou’d better let me wear it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank looked at the Vermont youth in surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“You, Ephraim?” he cried. “What’s struck you? It

<p class='c007'>Frank picked up another letter.</p>

woman write that stuff to yeou, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is not all,” said Merry. “She has ended, like the
others, by trying to make an appointment with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems to be getting pretty hot, Frank,” said Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too hot,” declared Merry, plainly annoyed. “I don’t
like it at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most actors would like it. They would be in their
glory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I am glad I’m not like most actors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yeou alwus was pop’ler with the ladies,” grinned the
Vermont youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t mind being popular with the ladies, but I do
not fancy this kind of popularity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’d never do for a matinée hero,” said Hodge. “I
have heard that they are deluged with mash notes. It
gets to be a common thing with them, and they don’t
mind it at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like to see such a display of weakness on the
part of human beings. Now, what does this woman who
has quoted <i>Juliet</i> to me know about me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As much as you know about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And she has taken chances of becoming a laughingstock
and object of ridicule by writing me such stuff. For
all she knows, I may be married.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, for all you know, she may be married.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe that is possible. No married woman

<p class='c007'>“If this one is married, she must be crazy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There came a knock on the door.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“There is a lady in the parlor who wishes to see Mr.
Merriwell,” said the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A lady?” exclaimed Frank, with a start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did she send up a card?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor give you her name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be down directly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy bowed, closed the door and departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim was chuckling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gol-durned ef they ain’t comin’ to see yeou, Frank!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense!” cried Merry. “This is not one of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then who is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be one of them,” said Hodge, rather maliciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Merry, but it was plain he did
not fancy the idea. “No one but a crazy female would
think of doing such an immodest thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“From what you have said, it’s plain you think some
females do get a little daffy over actors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whut ef it is one?” asked Ephraim, still chuckling.
“Whut will yeou do, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give her a little advice!” exclaimed Merry, as he
prepared to go. “I shall talk plainly to her. But it may
be some actress who is out of an engagement and wants a
position.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>He went out, leaving Bart and Ephraim in the room.
Frank was not in the most agreeable mood possible, for
he had been annoyed by the letters.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made his way straight to the ladies’ parlor. In a
corner a woman was sitting. No other person happened
to be in the parlor at the moment when Frank entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Frank came in, the woman rose quickly and came
toward him. He paused when he saw her face fairly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Scott!” was his mental exclamation. “It is the
one who threw the flowers from the box!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman was handsomely dressed, and she showed
some signs of agitation. Frank surveyed her quickly.
He saw at a glance that she was a person who seemed
more attractive at a distance than on closer view. Still
she was of the type that most men might call handsome.
There was a look of mingled boldness and hesitation
about her that was rather bewildering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice was not unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wish to see me, madam?” said Merry, rather
frigidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing in Frank’s manner to encourage
familiarity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you—don’t you recognize me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation was far from agreeable to him, and he
resolved to discourage her at the very start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not had the honor of being presented to you,”
he said, with a faint bow.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you recognize me? I threw you flowers—from
the box. There—there—was a—a note attached.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Madam, permit me to tell you it was very foolish for
you to write a note to an utter stranger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you—you did not seem like a stranger. You—why,
it seemed that I had known you always!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She half extended her hand, as if to rest it on his arm,
but he drew back. A shadow came over her face, and
a look of pain seemed to leap into her large dark eyes.
Very expressive eyes they were. At first they had
seemed full of innocence, but somehow there was something
uncertain and shifty about them—something that
gave their wide-open innocence the lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Frank, regretting the necessity of speaking
thus, yet feeling that he must, “it was very rash of
you. You could know nothing of me. For all you knew
I might be a rascal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, no, no!” she cried. “I knew you were not
that! A rascal could not play the part of <i>Dick Trueheart</i>
and make it so natural—so noble. I knew you had a
good and noble heart. I knew you were the one man in
all the wide world whom I could love!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was becoming more embarrassing for Merry. Somehow,
there was a mingled timidity and unspeakable boldness
about the woman that mystified him not a little. He
wondered if she could be just right, mentally.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam,” he said, “will you tell me at once what you
want of me. My time is limited.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, don’t speak to me like that!” she almost sobbed.
“It hurts me—here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>One hand fluttered up to her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, this is a nice mess!” thought Merriwell. “What
can I do with her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not like to run away; it did not seem dignified.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I watched you last night,” she went on, swiftly,
“I became more and more infatuated. When the curtain
fell on the third act I was completely carried away. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>knew I had found the hero of my life’s dream. I did not
know you. We had never met before. I knew of no
manner of obtaining an introduction. Then it was I resolved
to fling conventionality to the wind, and I hastily
wrote a single line on a slip of paper, which I attached to
the flowers I carried. Then, when you were called before
the curtain, I flung the flowers at your feet. You picked
them up—oh, bliss!—and bowed and smiled upon me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She seemed trembling with the great excitement that
governed her. The embarrassment of Frank’s position
increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hang it!” he thought. “I wish I had let those flowers
alone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went home,” the young woman continued. “And all
last night I dreamed of you, over and over and over.
They were happy dreams. Ah, I was so sorry when the
light of morning came in at my window and drove away
my dreams by robbing me of sleep. I tried to sleep and
dream some more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, she’s got it bad!” Merry mentally exclaimed.
“I’m afraid I’ll have trouble with this case. I wonder
if insanity runs in her family. She’s old enough to know
better, so she must be cracked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last,” the panting woman continued, leaning toward
him, “I arose, and I made a desperate resolve to
meet you somehow—anyhow. Then I wrote to you in
the words of <i>Juliet</i>, which seemed to express my feelings
so well. Did you receive my letter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” confessed Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face lighted up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah,” she sighed, “I wonder if you understood—I
wonder if you knew how sincere I was! Oh, I could
not write you everything, and I longed to so much, but
I knew you would not understand. As it was, I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to find a moment when my husband did not see me,
for he——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your husband?” grasped Merry, thunderstruck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he is so suspicious—so jealous and cruel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great heavens! madam, are you married?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am. I was married when I was sixteen—to a
man I hate! Oh, you cannot know the horror of being
bound to a person you hate! It is dreadful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, Merry was beginning to grow indignant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you, a married woman, are seeking a flirtation
with a stranger—an actor? Madam, your folly is astonishing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t—don’t speak to me like that!” she pleaded,
tears seeming to spring to her eyes. “I am not seeking
a flirtation! I am seeking to know my ideal. You—you
are my ideal!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the height of folly and rashness!” exclaimed
Frank, severely. “Madam, if you have no thought for
yourself, you should have some regard for me! Think
of the position in which you are placing me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if you care for me—if you love me——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more her hand fluttered up to her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is because you do not know me,” she declared.
“If you knew me—if you knew all about my terrible
position, tied to this man I hate, you would have sympathy
for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even though you are bound to a man you hate,
you are doing a most unwise thing in seeking consolation
from a stranger and an actor. You can know nothing
of me. Take my advice, madam, release yourself from
this man you hate before you seek to win the affections
of any other man. If you do not, you will succeed in
winning nothing but the disdain of any man worth
winning.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Again the tears brimmed in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how can you speak to me like that!” she cried.
“It is cruel of you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In this case, cruelty may be kindness. You have
placed me in a most awkward situation, madam. If you
have as much regard for me as you claim, it hardly
seems that you would do such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, what can a woman do when her heart governs
her in her every act! I felt that I must meet you, and
there was no other way for me to do so. I could not
let you go without knowing you—without seeking a
few words of consolation from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry for you, but you should let your
head govern your heart. I trust you will excuse me,
madam. This interview is anything but pleasant for
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He half turned away, but she uttered a cry that
stopped him. She seemed on the point of flinging herself
at his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Scott!” gasped Merry. “I hope she isn’t going
to make a scene of that sort! It would be too much!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t—don’t leave me just yet!” she entreated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must,” he firmly answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!” she exclaimed, her eyes beginning to flash.
“You cannot scorn me—you shall not! I have cast my
pride aside, and I have exposed myself to your ridicule—all
for what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The word seemed like a blow. For a moment he
fancied she was about to pour a torrent of angry words
upon him, but something entirely different happened.
With a low, queer cry, she sprang forward, attempting
to fling her arms about his neck!</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love you!” she panted.</p>

<p class='c007'>He grasped her wrists and held her off.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“You are crazy!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that instant a flushed and furious-looking man
burst into the parlor, carrying a revolver in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Villain!” cried the man. “That is my wife!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, this is jolly!” muttered Merry, wheeling to
face the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Reginald!” burst from the lips of the woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man paid no attention to her, but he glared at
Merry in a murderous manner, shaking the revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wretch!” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a man about thirty years of age, well dressed,
but somewhat dissipated in appearance. He seemed
wrought up to a pitch of great fury.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear sir,” said Merry, with the utmost coolness,
“you had better be careful with that revolver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be careful!” grated the angry husband. “I’ll be
careful with it! I’ll fill you full of lead!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I wouldn’t do that. You might be sorry for
it afterward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What were you doing with my wife?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Giving her a little advice, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know better! I know what I saw with my own
eyes! I tracked her here! I knew she flung flowers
to you last night! I knew she wrote to you this morning!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a lady sees fit to fling flowers to me, I can’t help
it. If she writes to me, I can’t prevent that”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you acknowledge it! That is enough! Now
I will shoot you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Reginald!” the woman again cried. “Heavens, he
will shoot!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the man lifted the revolver Frank leaped to one
side and sprang forward. In a twinkling he had grasped
the weapon. There was a short, sharp struggle, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the young actor leaped away, with the weapon in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I have stood about enough of this nonsense!”
he said, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man seemed astounded by the easy manner in
which he was disarmed, but he made a motion as if
thinking of following Frank up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t do it!” advised Merry. “The limit has been
reached! I did not seek the acquaintance of your wife,
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He caught a look from the trembling woman, and
he was puzzled by it. There seemed disappointment
and appeal in her eyes. Instantly Merry wondered what
he could say to shield her. It seemed strange that she
did not faint or go into hysterics at the sight of her
husband, but still there was an expression of terror on
her face that made Frank pity her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor, weak thing!” thought Merry. “There is no
telling what may be the result of this for her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he swiftly said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The lady was pleased with my play and my acting.
She came here to tell me so. It is possible she has
contemplated becoming an actress herself. She may
have come to me for that reason. If so, I advise her
to give up all thoughts of going on the stage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was lame enough, but it was the best he could do
under the circumstances without lying direct. Frank
hated a liar, and yet he realized there were times when
a man’s gallantry to a woman would force him to deviate
from the direct truth. Such a “deviation” did not seem
like a genuine lie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah!” cried the man, scornfully. “Don’t think you
can make me believe such rot as that! I know better!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are at liberty to believe it or not, just as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>like, sir,” said Merry. “But I have stood quite enough
nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you have? And you enticed my wife here to
meet you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did nothing of the kind, sir. Your wife came here
entirely of her own accord, without enticement of any
kind from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know better! You can’t make me believe it
was because she was interested in your play. She’ll not
dare say that. Tell the truth woman—why did you
come here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She threw back her head, and then a strange, defiant
laugh burst from her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, sir,” she sneered. “I will tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on, go on! Why did you come here, madam?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came because I wished to meet Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! You confess it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I confess it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah-a!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I admire him—I love him!” declared the woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah-a!” again burst from the lips of her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is my ideal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You hear that, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank heard it, and he realized that his efforts to
shield her had been worse than useless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for you,” she went on, giving her husband a
scornful look. “I thought I loved you once—till I saw
Frank Merriwell. Now—now I despise you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Jove! this is getting hot again!” thought Merry.
“What fools some women are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man ground his teeth together and walked the
floor. He threw his hat aside and tore his hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew it!” he panted. “This cheap actor has won
your heart! He has alienated your affections from me!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Don’t dare call him a cheap actor!” she exclaimed,
haughtily. “He is grand and noble!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must make a noble picture just now,” thought
Frank, in deep disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words of the woman seemed to throw the man
into still greater fury, and it appears that he was about
to attack her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to defend her if he does,” Frank mentally
decided.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woman, woman!” panted the furious husband, glaring
at her. “Is this what you have come to!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” she returned, defiantly. “What are you going
to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll kill you—I’ll kill you both!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A man who threatens that way seldom carries out
his threats,” was Merry’s consoling thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead,” defied the woman. “I rather think Frank
Merriwell can protect me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Protect you! I am the one to protect you! And you
have turned to this common actor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Cheap actor!’ ‘Common actor!’” muttered Merry.
“This is real jolly!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You protect me!” sneered the woman. “I am done
with you! I shall leave you forever!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And this wretch has caused it all. You cannot deny
that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not wish to deny it. Ever since his eyes met
mine, I have felt myself drawn to him by an irresistible
influence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has hypnotized you! Oh, he shall pay dearly for
this!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The husband shook his fist at Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has won my heart, and I can never be anything
to you again,” laughed the reckless woman.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Oh, you scoundrel!” shouted the man. “You have
ruined my happiness! I swear you shall pay for it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I have stood quite enough of this!” Merry
broke out. “I deny that I have interfered with you in
any way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can you deny it—liar?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you dare use such language again, I’ll be tempted
to give you the thrashing you seem to desire, sir!”
flashed Frank. “I am very sorry this unfortunate affair
has taken place, but I declare it is in no way my fault.
At first I was inclined to protect this lady, but she has
seen fit to make that impossible, and now I feel at liberty
to tell the whole truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell it! tell it—if you dare!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will, in a very few words. I confess that your
wife threw me flowers from a box last night, and she
came here to meet me to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then there was an appointment?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I did not know she was coming. She did not
send up her card, but the boy said a lady wished to
see me in the parlor. I believe every man should be as
gallant to ladies as circumstances will permit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes!” sneered the husband, his lips curling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came down to see what the lady desired. Your
wife was here. I was in no way responsible for what
followed, but I assure you that she received no encouragement
from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did I see as I entered this room?” demanded
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You saw me preventing her from clasping her arms
about my neck. I had just told her how foolish she
was, but she would not be rebuffed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Liar!” panted the husband, seeming to become still
more furious. “Do you dare accuse my wife of such
immodesty! Do you dare charge her with following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>you without encouragement! She would not do such a
thing. You are trying to shield yourself behind a woman,
you cowardly young——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!” exploded Frank, stepping forward. “I have
stood quite enough of this from you! I am sorry for
you, but I am not willing to be called all sorts of vile
names. Your wife forced me to tell the truth and the
whole truth. I do not fancy lying, but I might have
stretched the truth to protect her if she had given me
any chance. She gave me no chance. She came here
of her own accord, without encouragement from me,
and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you shall pay for every word you speak! You
dare thus traduce my wife, you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop again! I have seen quite enough of both you
and your wife. I trust you will be good enough to take
her away. She is not the only one to write me mash
notes, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the husband interrupted:</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you boast of your conquests! You are a gallant
young blade! But you are like all actors, a poor, miserable——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are like all jealous husbands—you have not a
particle of sense in your head. You are decidedly exasperating,
sir. Be kind enough to take your wife
and go!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not go with him!” panted the woman, suddenly
rushing on Frank and clasping him about the
neck. “I will stay with you! You are the one I love!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>UNMASKED!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At this moment another man stepped into the parlor.
He wore a long overcoat and his features were hidden
by a full beard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha!” shouted the husband, triumphantly, rushing at
this man and catching him by the arm, while he pointed
toward Merry and the woman. “Look there! See! I
want you for a witness in this matter, Mr. Davis! There
is my wife with this wretch of an actor who has enticed
her here! Do you see—do you see?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The other nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I see,” he said in a muffled voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t forget it, Davis! I shall want your testimony
in court.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll not forget it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Merry had succeeded in putting the
woman aside again, and now he was thoroughly exasperated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is plain you are determined to get me into a fine
mess!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take me away with you! He will kill me if you
don’t!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Madam, you have passed the limit! I think you
should be in an insane asylum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you are cruel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I feel a trifle that way!” confessed Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he started toward the two men, but they turned
toward the door, the husband crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have him arrested!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“No! I am going for an officer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Bart Hodge appeared in the door, saying, grimly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be in a rush, gentlemen. Mr. Merriwell wishes
to talk with you a little.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stand aside!” snarled the husband, with a threatening
gesture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you would try that little trick!” flared Hodge,
his face flushing suddenly. “I believe I’d enjoy a good
scrap. I haven’t taken a hand in one for so long that
it would be a satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us pass!” growled the man with the full beard
and the muffled voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what they say in melodrama,” observed Hodge,
with grim humor. “‘Unhand me, villain!’ and ‘Let
me pass!’ are stock phrases. There is no copyright on
them, so you may use them whenever you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry was somewhat surprised by Bart’s cool manner,
but he knew there was a slumbering volcano beneath
all that coolness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rush on him!” came hoarsely from the bearded
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, do!” urged Hodge, putting up his hands. “I’ll
manage to get a pop at you both, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold them, Hodge,” directed Frank. “I have something
to say to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s up, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe there is a game on,” answered Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A game?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blackmail!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman uttered a scream, and something like an
oath came from the man who had professed to be her
husband.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“This is interesting!” exclaimed Hodge. “Then it appears
that I happened on the scene just in time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ll not get out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will!” growled the man called Davis. “Come on,
Seely!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m ready!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, Bart, if yeou can’t hold the ’darn critters alone,
I ruther guess we kin both do it,” drawled a voice, and
Ephraim Gallup appeared to reënforce Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men uttered exclamations of disappointment, alarm
and disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Merriwell laughed shortly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I wouldn’t hurry away. Just
wait a while, and we will settle this little matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He advanced on them, scanning Davis closely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe I have seen you before,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never,” answered the bewhiskered man, seeming
anxious to get out of the room. “I do not know you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you speak in your natural tone?” asked
Merry, sweetly. “You will injure your voice trying to
disguise it by growling like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You go to blazes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you for the invitation, but I have found things
quite hot enough right here to suit me. Now, if the
tables should be turned, and you were to find it rather
warm, it would be no more than fair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both men seemed anxious, but the professed husband
attempted to bluster again. His anger seemed artificial,
however, and he did not impress anyone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Acts like a rooster with his tail feathers yanked out,”
grinned Gallup. “He’s mighty mad over it, but the
feathers are gone jest the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge had his lips pressed together, and he looked
ready for anything that might happen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>A few words passed between the two men. It was
plain they contemplated rushing on Bart and Ephraim
in order to break from the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank strode forward quickly and grasped the bewhiskered
man by the shoulder, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me have a fair look at you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow turned with a snarl, striking hard at Merriwell’s
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank ducked, thus avoiding the blow. A second later,
he caught hold of the fellow’s whiskers, gave a yank,
and off they came in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were false!</p>

<p class='c007'>The man’s face was revealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lester Vance!” cried Frank, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a complete unmasking. The face of the
rascally actor who had been “released,” on account of
his crooked work in Atchison, was exposed by the sudden
tearing away of the false beard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great gosh!” gurgled Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge said nothing, but he glared at Vance with a
look of deepest hatred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance himself seemed stricken dumb.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman dropped down on a chair, and her “husband”
stood and uttered some words which would not
look well in print.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Merriwell laughed chillingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A very pretty little game!” he commented, sarcastically;
“but it is all up now. It didn’t work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was no game!” snarled the man called Reginald
by the woman. “You can’t get out of it so easy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be lucky if you get out of it short of six
years,” said Hodge. “The law is rather severe on blackmailers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And on thieves,” put in Ephraim, who had learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of Lester Vance’s crooked work. “They make a purty
good pair, by gum!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vance,” said Merriwell, “you were foolish not to
take my advice and get as far away from us as possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance muttered something.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you were doubly foolish,” Merry went on, “to
come here in such a slim disguise to aid in this miserable
attempt to blackmail me. I have been an actor too
long not to tumble to false whiskers when I see them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take my advice, Merriwell,” cried Hodge, “land that
snake in prison! You can afford the time to get such a
rascal out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance was very pale, and showed agitation and fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, by gum!” nodded Ephraim. “He is a
snake, an’ I’d shove him naow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vance exchanged looks with the other rascal. It was
plain both men were confounded by the turn affairs
had taken. But the one who claimed to be the woman’s
husband had obtained another revolver, and, of a sudden,
he pointed it at Frank Merriwell, crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“At least, I’ll shoot the villain who has trifled with my
wife!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not one of the young actors was near enough to
prevent him from shooting if he wished, but Merry instantly
faced him, looking straight into his eyes over the
top of the revolver, and calmly saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a good bluffer, sir, but you haven’t the least
idea of shooting anybody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then he walked straight up to the man, took hold
of his hand and pushed the revolver aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give it to him!” exclaimed Gallup. “I don’t want no
darn fool p’intin’ pistols at me, by thutteration!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow made a sudden attempt to spring backward
with the revolver. He had been dazed by Merriwell’s
calmness and audacity, but now he resorted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>action. He realized that the young actor fully fathomed
him, and it stung him to madness to think that his
bluff had been “called” in such a prompt manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank, however, had taken hold of the weapon, and,
with a sudden twist, he jerked it from the hand of the
man, disarming the fellow in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eyes of Hodge glittered with satisfaction. This
was Merriwell in his old form. Not a whit of his nerve
had Frank lost since the more exciting days at Yale,
on the diamond, the gridiron, in the cane rushes and
college bouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having the revolver in his hand, Frank snapped it
open, and then he burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Empty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that word, he flung it at the man’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, I be darned!” gasped Gallup, and then he
roared with laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>This laughing seemed to infuriate the one who claimed
to be the husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Curse you!” he snarled, catching up the revolver.
“It won’t take long to load it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He plunged a hand into his pocket, as if reaching for
cartridges.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t advise you to load it, sir,” said Merry,
placidly. “It will go harder with you if you are found
with a loaded weapon when the officer comes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The officer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Hodge, call a boy and send out for a policeman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you mean——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Business!” finished Frank, grimly. “I don’t like
blackmailers, and I think they are dangerous, so I fancy
I’ll have you put away for safe-keeping.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right!” cried Hodge, with intense satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman began to weep.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Lester Vance looked around, as if in search of some
avenue of escape. At last he realized that he was in a
very bad scrape, and he longed to be well out of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once, with a wild cry, the woman sprang up,
rushed at Frank, clasped him about the neck and began
to scream. Shriek after shriek came from her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry attempted to put her away, but she clung to him
in a frantic manner, continuing to scream.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her wild cries brought bell boys, porter, clerk, guests
and others rushing onto the scene, and crowding into
the parlor. There were some moments of general confusion,
a struggle near the door, and then the woman
seemed to swoon and slip to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Merry was questioned, of course he was
regarded with suspicion. A pompous man demanded to
know the meaning of it, looking accusingly and scornfully
at Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a very few words, Frank explained that an attempt
at blackmail had been made, but when he looked
round to point out the two men concerned in the crooked
work, he found they had slipped away in the general
confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gol-darned if I noticed when they got aout!” exclaimed
Gallup, in chagrin. “I was so upset by the howlin’
of that air woman that I never saw nothin’ else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s Hodge?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here,” said Bart, coming forward, and Merriwell saw
that he also looked crestfallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are those men?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tried to hold Vance,” answered Hodge, “but some
men seemed to think I was trying to murder him, and
they parted us, giving him a chance to get away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen,” said Merriwell, speaking to the assembled
crowd, “I think you see how it is. The scoundrels
have taken to their heels, leaving this unfortunate woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>here to get out of it as best she can. The way they ran
must convince you that they are just what I claimed—blackmailers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman showed signs of reviving. A gallant man
assisted her to rise, and she quickly dropped down on
the sofa, seeming weak and faint. As she was rather
handsome, the man, like men, began to say there must
be some mistake, as it was not possible she had been
concerned in an attempt at blackmail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank listened to them with a faint smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They make me sick!” growled Hodge. “If she were
old and plain, they wouldn’t take so much interest in
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of a sudden, the woman sprang up, her eyes flashing,
her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me pass!” she exclaimed, dramatically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The same old melodrama line!” murmured Merry,
seeming indifferent in regard to the woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you going to let her go?” hissed Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t do it, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are foolish! You——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait, Bart; we’ll talk of this later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And she will get away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge seemed inclined to make an attempt to stop
the woman, but Merriwell restrained him, to his deep
disgust.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of the room walked the woman, and she hurried
straight from the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The show is over, gentlemen,” laughed Frank. “I
trust you have received your money’s worth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he bade Hodge and Gallup follow, and left the
parlor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>MORE ADVENTURES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Bart followed Merry to his room, and Ephraim trailed
along behind. When they were in the room, Merry fell
to laughing. Hodge flung himself down on a chair,
looking sullen and sour, upon which Frank laughed the
harder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim sat on the edge of the bed and grinned, but
seemed to be in doubt whether he had better laugh or
not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come, Hodge!” cried Merry. “What’s the
use to look that way? It’s all over now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge growled something under his breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think yeou’d be hoppin’ mad yourself,
Frank,” said Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he laughs at everything!” exploded Bart. “He
says I have no sense of humor. Well, I am glad I
haven’t if he sees anything funny about this business!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly I do see something funny about it,” asserted
Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The idea of anybody attempting to blackmail an
actor—a traveling showman. It is enough to make a
horse laugh. I doubt if such a remarkable thing ever
happened before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim began to see the affair from Frank’s viewpoint,
and his grin broadened with great rapidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” he cried. “I never thought of that! I
guess folks wouldn’t b’lieve it ef yeou was to tell um.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still I fail to see what there is laughable about it,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>snapped Bart. “The fellow knew you had money—Vance
told him that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he knew you were young. He fancied you
would be easy game. Where is there anything funny
about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am an actor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you are a dead easy thing!” declared Bart.
“Think of letting that woman go in such a manner!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Hodge,” said Frank, with more seriousness,
“after I have talked to you a bit, I rather fancy I can
make you acknowledge that was the most sensible thing
to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, you can’t! You’re forever doing things like
that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know I was in earnest about giving Vance and
the other rascal their dues. You know that, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it was a surprise to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still you know it, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seemed to be ready.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly. It was not my fault that they escaped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart flushed and looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose it was my fault?” he cried, almost resentfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not mean that. I do not blame you, Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought you did. I’d held onto Vance if those fool
men hadn’t interfered. They gave him his chance, and
he took it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal,” drawled Ephraim, sheepishly. “I own right
up, b’gosh! that I was so ’tarnally flustered when that
woman began to yoop her up that I didn’t notice nothin’
till the men hed got erway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which was exactly what the woman wanted,” said
Merriwell. “She grabbed me and screamed like that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>order to give the men a chance to skip. They took
the chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which shows she was just as bad as the men,” said
Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” nodded Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you let her get away! Oh, it’s like you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hodge, do you remember what you said when those
men in the parlor were declaring the woman was too
refined-looking to be engaged in a blackmailing scheme?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I said they made me sick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was it. You also said that were she plain and
old they would not make such a fuss over her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, old man, at that moment I realized how little
chance there was of convicting that woman of blackmail
were she arrested. Do you suppose a jury of twelve men
would have agreed to convict a young and handsome
woman like that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge was silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Answer!” exclaimed Frank. “Do you suppose that
woman could have been convicted?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I doubt it,” admitted Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was the very reason I was willing to let her
go. I should have been foolish to put myself to the
trouble of prosecuting her with every chance against
conviction. I knew that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart jumped up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Men are bigger fools than women!” he snapped. “I
am beginning to realize that better and better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you are a woman hater!” laughed Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t fling that at me! A pretty woman will make
a fool of a man any day, and it is impossible to find
twelve men who will convict a pretty woman of crime
if they can help it. Adventuresses know it, and they
profit by it. If they are arrested, they work all their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>arts on judge and jury, and in nine cases out of ten,
they go scot-free. The old fools on the jury ogle the
pretty prisoner, and sometimes they openly flirt with her.
They sympathize with her because she is young and
pretty, and, when the evidence is so strong they cannot
acquit her, they disagree. Yes, men are fools!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That being the case,” he said, “I think you will have
to admit that I was wise in letting the woman go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps so,” acknowledged Hodge; “but I hated to
see her get off. She was the chief one in a pretty mean
piece of business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think she was the chief one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then who——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you let him off after he had robbed you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He returned every dollar of the money, and I did
not lose anything. A man in my place can’t afford to
spend time in lawsuits. It would ruin my plans. Vance
seemed thankful to get away, and I hoped we’d not hear
anything from him again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You hoped in vain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll hear from him again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we do——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be unfortunate for Lester Vance,” said Merry.
“He has reached the limit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” cried Gallup, staring at Frank. “He wants
to keep out of the way naow! When Frank Merriwell
looks that way, he’s out fer business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge also saw the look on Merry’s face, and he
recognized it as the peculiar expression Frank wore
whenever his patience was exhausted and he had decided
to crush an enemy. And remembering things which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>happened in the past, Bart knew well enough that Frank
could strike an enemy with terrible effect when he wished
to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was on his way to the theater that afternoon,
swinging along at a lively pace, paying very little attention
to anybody, when somebody called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked up quickly, and saw approaching him a
rather good-looking girl of about nineteen. She was
rather gaudily attired, and he noticed instantly that she
carried some pinks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Scott!” muttered Merry. “It’s another one
of them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He waited, although he really felt like running away.
The girl came forward smiling. There was something
rather saucy in her manner, and he saw there was paint
on her cheeks and rouge on her lips. As soon as he
discovered this, his desire to hasten away increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why,” laughed the girl, “you do not seem a bit glad
to see me. Perhaps you did not receive my note.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know you, miss,” said Merry. “I do not
think we have been introduced.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Introduced! Ha! ha! ha! What do you care! I’ll
introduce myself. I’m Daisy Blaney.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Blaney, don’t you think you are rather foolish
to speak to a stranger like this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I guess not! You’re all right. I said that as
soon as I saw you come onto the stage last night. I
wondered if you looked as well off the stage as you do
on it, and by gracious! I believe you look handsomer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was almost too much for Frank. He flushed
painfully, which seemed to add to the girl’s enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Blaney!” he said, grimly, “I must say you are
rather outspoken in your compliments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a little way I have, my dear fellow. Why, I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>believe you are blushing! Who ever heard of an actor
that blushed! Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank’s embarrassment increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, say!” the girl went on; “don’t look at me that
way. What do you care? I wanted to get acquainted
with you, and there wasn’t any other way to do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then it would have been better not to do it at all.
Aren’t you aware you are putting yourself in a very bad
light by deliberately seeking the acquaintance of a man
and making it in such a manner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if you aren’t a queer actor!” she cried. “I
have met lots of them, but I never struck one like you
before. Usually they are ready enough to become acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid you have judged all actors by the ones
you have met in this irregular manner. There are honorable
men who are actors, the same as there are honorable
men in other professions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl whistled softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that so? That’s all right! That’s why I wanted
to meet you. I reckoned you were on the dead level.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No man who is on the dead level will seek the acquaintance
of any young lady in this manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No? Oh, come off! I’ve met lots of fellows who
were all right, and I never had an introduction to them,
either. You must have old-fashioned notions in your
head, and you are the last chap I’d ever thought had
’em. Why, I took you for a fellow who would be rather
lively! You must be dead slow. You need somebody
to wake you up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid you are not slow, miss!” exclaimed Merry,
severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I’m not. I don’t like slow coaches. Oh, say,
Frank, come out of it! What do you take me for?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“For a very foolish girl, Miss Blaney. I am sorry
for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorry! Oh, come off! You must belong to the Y.
M. C. A.! By George! I didn’t think you would lecture
me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t time to give you a lecture, but I think you
should receive one. I’d like to talk with you a while,
for I think I could show you the folly of what you are
doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you in earnest?” asked the girl, beginning to
show astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never more so in my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you beat the band! And I thought you were
sporty!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope I am not sporty in the way you mean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must have wings sprouting! Are you kidding
me? What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am saying what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you do not believe in having a good time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the contrary, I do believe in having a good time.
I believe everybody should have a good time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you are shouting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there is a right way to have a good time, and
a wrong way. I fancy you often think you are having
a good time when you are deceiving yourself. One kind
of a good time leads to satisfaction and pleasant memories;
another kind of a good time leads to misery and
remorse. My dear girl, be careful what kind of a good
time you choose to have.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, say, you ought to be a preacher! You an actor!
You have made a mistake!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An actor may be a preacher. He may preach morality
in his acting. I believe an actor has the greatest
opportunities for doing good by his methods of preaching.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Excuse me while I draw my breath! You’ve knocked
me silly!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fancy you have met the worst class of actors, Miss
Blaney. You thought them all alike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never saw one before that wasn’t ready enough to
make a mash and have a racket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank saw he was not making much impression on the
girl. He had discovered that she was rather bright,
for all that she was so reckless in her manner, and he was
truly sorry for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad to say all actors are not mashers,” he said,
slowly. “I hope none of my company are. My dear
girl, you are making the mistake of your life by seeking
the acquaintance of strange men in such a manner—by
having anything at all to do with strange men. Don’t
do it any more. You are good-looking, and I fancy you
have a good education. Be careful what you do. By
your actions you can win the scorn or the respect of
people, just as you choose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t talk to me that way!” she cried, with
curling lips. “It’s too late!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why too late?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, people think I’m fly, and I can’t change their
minds now. I’ve got the name, whether I deserve it or
not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is to blame? You must have given them reasons
for thinking so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I have!” she exclaimed, defiantly, all the
laughter gone from her face in a moment. “But I did it
because they began to talk about me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you do to make them talk about you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I didn’t die! I was ready to have some harmless
sport, and they began to say I was gay. That made
me mad. I said I would give them something to talk
about—and I did!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“And there was where you made your greatest mistake,
my dear girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, don’t talk to me that way. I’ve heard enough
of it from other people! I didn’t want to get acquainted
with you to be preached at—not by a long shot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Blaney, have you no thought for others? Is
there no person whose heart you are breaking by your
recklessness? Your mother——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t—don’t talk to me about her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because—oh, just because!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I understand. Your mother worries over you.
She has tried to talk with you and tell you you were
doing wrong. Am I not right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She talked too much. That’s what drove me away
from home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drove you away from home? Then you have left
home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A week ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do your folks know where you are?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And they let you go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old man says I needn’t ever come home again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But your mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl’s head drooped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose mother is all broken up,” she confessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t you been to see her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t. It’s too far!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We live in Carrolton. I ran away from home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Merry’s interest was thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you happen to come to St. Jo.?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ve got friends here. I’ve been here visiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>twice before. The first time I was here was when I
began to flirt with an actor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Blaney, you should return home. Your mother
will be glad to see you, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old man will kick me out. It’s no use, Frank
Merriwell. I think you mean well enough, but you are
off your trolley in regard to me. I can’t go back now,
and I’m bound to have a good time while there is a good
time going. I thought you were sporty, but I see I made
a mistake. I reckon I’d better shift along. You are all
right—from your head up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a moment. We play in Carrolton to-morrow
night. Can I not take a message to your mother from
you? Think how she must feel. Can’t I tell her something
that will cheer her up?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the use?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know but her heart is breaking for
you? Perhaps she prays for you night and day. Perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t!” cried the girl. “I don’t like to hear about
that. No, I won’t send a message by you. The idea
that an actor should want to take such a message! Ha!
ha! ha! Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous! Ha! ha! ha!
ha!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl’s laughter caused him to shiver a bit. It
was not the laugh of genuine merriment—it was forced
and unnatural.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was quick to see how it touched him, and she suddenly
cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t mind me! I’m not worth it! You have tried
to give me some good advice, but it’s a waste of breath.
I’m going to do as I like, no matter what comes of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whatever you do,” said Frank, with deep earnestness,
“don’t forget your mother! When you are having
a good time, as you call it, think of your mother. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>you are gay, think of your mother, who may be praying
for you at that moment. That is all, Miss Blaney. Good-by!
I would like to know that some day—very soon—you
go back to your mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not laughing now. All the false merriment
had gone out of her face, leaving it very sober. Something
like tears seemed to fill her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by,” said Frank, once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a word, the girl turned swiftly and hurried
away, almost running.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too bad!” he muttered, as he hurried on to the
theater.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>FRANK SPEAKS HIS MIND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the stage door he saw Douglas Dunton talking to
a very pretty, blue-eyed girl, who started and blushed
when she beheld Frank, quickly exclaiming in a low
tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, there is Mr. Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind him,” laughed Dunton. “He’s not the
only pebble on the beach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank said not a word, but entered the theater, apparently
to the disappointment of the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time later, Dunton came in. Frank called him
aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Dunton,” he said, “but there
is a matter I wish to speak about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s all right,” grinned Douglas. “I knew you
didn’t want to catch on there, old man. Elsie Bellwood
or Inza Burrage is your style. This girl——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you know I mean to speak of the girl?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that wasn’t so hard to guess! She’s all broken
up over you, but I think she can be induced to forget
you. She is a little beauty, only she’s rather light-headed
and thinks she’d like to be an actress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Foolish child!” said Merry, scowling. “She needs
somebody to look after her closely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I wouldn’t mind taking the job of looking after
her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In what way, Dunton? How did you meet the girl?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, she was walking around outside the theater, and
I simply walked up and spoke to her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You never saw her before?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Of course not. It was a case of mash.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank scowled still more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dunton,” he said, “I hope you are not a masher. I
hope you do not make it a practice of trying to mash
pretty girls in the places where we play.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, of course not; but when——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mashing actors I detest,” declared Frank, plainly.
“They have done no end of harm. They have given the
profession a bad name. I would like a company who did
not make a business of mashing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t make a business of it!” protested Douglas.
“But when a fellow sees a nice little thing like this, he
doesn’t feel like letting it go by—especially when it is
easy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry you spoke to the girl. She has an innocent
face. Dunton, I wish you would let such girls alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What? Why, you wouldn’t want the members of
your company running around with fly girls in the places
where we go, would you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I want them to mind their own business. I hope
you will understand me, my dear fellow, and will not be
offended. I do not wish my people to get a bad name by
associating with those who are bad; nor do I wish them
to get bad names by misleading those who are weak and
foolish. It is likely that little girl has a mother who——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; her mother is dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So much the worse. She has no one to look out for
her and restrain her. She can easily be influenced in the
wrong direction. No man who is a man will mislead such
a girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton was restless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’re putting it too strong, Mr. Merriwell,” he
said. “There is no harm in a little flirtation with a pretty
girl. Don’t be jealous because I happened to catch on to
her before you came along.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>He tried to turn this remark with a laugh, but Frank
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know very well that is not why I am speaking to
you. There was something about that girl’s innocent
face that made me sorry for her. She is trembling on the
brink of a downward path, I am sure of it. She is a girl
not naturally bad, but she has her head filled with false
notions, and she needs somebody to look out for her till
she gets old enough to become aware that those ideas are
false.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you are making too much of this, Mr. Merriwell.
Don’t worry about girls like that. There are thousands
of them. They are everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All the more reason why a man should take an interest
in them. If one of them can be prevented from making
the fatal mistake, it is a great thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If they are bound to be gay, they’ll be so, and you
may lecture to them all you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I hope no one in my company will help any girl
to become ‘gay,’ as you call it. That is all I have to say,
Dunton. I trust you will understand me. I don’t wish to
meddle with your business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank knew it was useless to say anything more or
talk plainer. Dunton understood him, and all he might
add to what he had said would make no deeper impression.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night the theater was packed to the doors. The
“S. R. O.” sign was put out some time before the curtain
went up, and several hundred more seats might have been
sold. More than ever was the manager of the house
delighted. He declared “True Blue” the greatest drawing
card of the season, and he offered all kinds of bookings
for next season.</p>

<p class='c007'>The performance went off smoothly. The splendid
climaxes in each act received tumultuous applause, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the end of the third act the audience was worked up to a
pitch of great excitement. There were repeated curtain
calls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell,” said Hodge, his dark face flushed with
excitement, “this play beats your first one out of sight.
I’ve never acknowledged it before, but I do now. ‘John
Smith’ was not in it with this piece. Oh, but you wouldn’t
do a thing with this in New Haven! Can’t you play
there, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps,” smiled Merry, in a singular way. “I am
going to put the play to the test in Chicago. We’ll be
there the first of next week, and then we jump to New
York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” cried Hodge. “And you have never told me
before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I have been working for those engagements,
but did not know that I’d get them. We play a week in
New York. It’s make or break, old man. I started out
on that plan, and I’m going to stick to it. I’ve been aiming
for the top notch, and I’ll get there if it is possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll get there!” exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was almost the last one of the company to leave
the theater that night. He had remained to see that
everything was properly cared for, being anxious that
there should be no further hitches in the performance of
“True Blue.” The company carried quite a lot of special
scenery and mechanical “effects,” the most striking of
which were those used in the great boat race scene which
concluded the third act of the play, and Frank wished to
be certain that everything was properly handled in getting
it ready for shipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Well satisfied, Merry was walking swiftly toward his
hotel when he noticed two persons entering a restaurant.
He paused instantly, whistling softly to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Dunton and the blue-eyed girl!” he exclaimed. “He
made a date with her, and she met him after the performance.
I’m sorry she did it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He went forward till he could look into the front window
of the restaurant, and he saw the actor and girl pass
behind a screen down the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose the tables reserved for ladies must be down
there,” muttered Frank. “Well, I don’t like the idea of
playing the spy on anybody, and so I think I will let them
alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He walked on, but his sense of satisfaction had passed,
and he was depressed. Although he tried to forget the
actor and the girl, he found he could not do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the hotel was reached, he stopped short and
stood in deep thought for some minutes. The blue eyes
and innocent face of the girl haunted him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t abandon her to what may happen!” he muttered.
“No, even though I hate to play the spy. It is my
duty to see that no harm comes to that foolish girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned squarely about and retraced his steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaching the restaurant, he entered and walked down
the room till he reached a table near the screen. There he
took a seat, for, just as he reached that place he noticed
a mirror set against the wall in such a position that it reflected
a certain portion of the room beyond the screen,
and that mirror showed him Dunton and the blue-eyed
girl sitting at a table. Frank sat down where he could
watch their every movement by aid of the mirror.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a number of couples in the room beyond the
screen, and the sound of talk and laughter came plainly
to Merry’s ears. Three men besides himself had taken
seats in his part of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry had sized up the place quickly. He decided that
it was a second-rate restaurant, catering to the class of
people who kept late hours.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>A waiter came for his order, and Frank realized that
he was hungry, so he ran over the bill of fare and ordered
something he fancied would satisfy his appetite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will you drink?” asked the waiter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Water,” was Frank’s answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wouldn’t you like beer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tea or coffee?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The waiter lifted his eyebrows in surprise and departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>While waiting for the order to be served Merry
watched the reflections of Dunton and the blue-eyed girl.
The actor was doing his best to make her feel at ease,
but it was evident that the experience of dining with a
man in a restaurant at that hour of the night was novel to
her, and she was nervous and excited, although she made
efforts to appear at ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The popping of corks and clinking of glasses came
from beyond the screen. The laughter of the men and
women was of the strained and artificial kind. One man
was talking rather loudly in a manner that plainly indicated
his tongue felt thick and unwieldy. Occasionally
a woman would begin to sing, but her companions cut
her off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A bad place for the blue-eyed girl!” thought Merry.
“I doubt if she ever saw anything like it before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton was talking earnestly to the girl. He seemed
to be telling her some sort of story, and he was using
every fascination of which he was capable. On the stage,
Dunton usually played heavies and villains; in everyday
life Dunton was something of a comedian. Now he was
able to bring fleeting smiles and nervous laughter to the
lips of his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>A waiter brought them an addition to their order.
Dunton told a funny story that seemed to amuse and
startle the girl, for she looked at him reprovingly, even
while she laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they are not drinking!” muttered Frank, with no
small satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>His own order was filled after a time, and he fell to
eating. He had begun to wonder if he had not made a
mistake in thinking the girl in any serious danger. Perhaps
Dunton had not known the real character of the restaurant
when he took her in there. Still, Frank was sorry
she had been brought into a place where such people
could sit near her and she could hear the sounds and see
hints of the false pleasures which lure so many girls to
waywardness.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some little time Merry did not pay much attention
to what was taking place behind the screen. At length,
he observed that Dunton was leaning over the narrow
table and talking in a low tone to the girl, his eyes looking
into hers. The actor had secured one of her hands. As
she listened, the color in her cheeks came and went. She
seemed confused and abashed, yet fascinated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, Frank knew she was in real danger. He thrilled
all over, and half started from his seat, but dropped back,
muttering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A waiter came with two bottles, buried to their necks
in cracked ice. He stopped at their table and prepared to
open the bottles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank felt that the time for action was close at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>One bottle was opened and glasses were filled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was astounded that Dunton should think of
“blowing himself” on champagne, for that was what, beyond
a doubt, the bottles contained. It was a most remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>thing for an actor to open anything so expensive
for a stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the wine was placed before the girl, she hesitated
and drew back. Frank was watching her closely,
and that movement, that hesitation, settled him in the resolve
to act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton leaned over the table, laughing and coaxing
her. In a good-natured way, he was ridiculing her into
drinking the wine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank felt his blood tingling in his body as he watched
this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry rose to his feet. A check had been placed on his
table, and he tossed the amount of his bill beside it.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the while he was watching the girl. He hoped she
would refuse to touch the wine, but he realized she lacked
the firmness to do so. Her face, though pretty, betrayed
in its mold the weakness of her character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton was winning. The girl looked at the wine,
while he continued in his persuasive way to urge her to
try it. In hesitation and laughing confusion she asked
him something, and Frank knew he was declaring on his
honor that the wine was harmless.</p>

<p class='c007'>She reached out her hand, which trembled the least bit,
and took up the glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then, just as Dunton was clinking his glass against
that of his pretty companion, Frank walked round the
screen. The girl lifted her glass to drink.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell stood beside the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss,” he said, quietly, “I wouldn’t do it if I were
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She gave a little cry of alarm, and nearly dropped the
glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton stared at Frank and muttered an exclamation
of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Oh, it’s Mr. Merriwell!” cried the girl, in mingled delight,
confusion and shame, as she put the wine down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is!” said Dunton; “but where the dickens did
he come from?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank looked the actor sternly in the eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I wasted my breath when I talked to you to-night,
Dunton,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man moved restlessly in his chair, and his face
flushed in an angry way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you been spying on me, Mr. Merriwell?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been watching you,” said Frank, honestly.
“It was purely by accident that I saw you come in here
with this young lady. I came in also and sat out there
beyond the screen. I sat down where, by the aid of the
mirror yonder, I could see everything you did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton’s anger threatened to flare forth. He half
started up, but dropped back, grating his teeth together.
His look just then reminded Merry of the time when, infuriated
beyond endurance, Dunton had tried to wound or
kill Frank in a sword combat on the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why have you done this?” snarled the angry actor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I was impressed by the innocent appearance
of this girl, and I feared for her safety. I thought it
possible I had been mistaken till I saw this wine brought
on, and now——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now—what?” hissed Dunton, in great excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Frank, looking straight into the eyes of
the girl, “I’m going to take this young lady home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a savage exclamation Dunton sprang to his feet,
staring at Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, this is the greatest case of nerve!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl looked frightened and seemed on the verge of
bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Steady, Dunton!” commanded Merry, turning on him.
“Don’t make a scene. It will do no good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think this is a very nice thing for you to do,
Mr. Merriwell!” panted Dunton. “Don’t you think you
are overstepping the bounds?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fancy not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the young lady will not go with you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the contrary, I am quite sure she will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not on your life! She is with me! I believe you are
jealous because you did not catch on with——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c007'>That word cut the speaker off instantly. Merriwell’s
eyes looked dangerous just then, and Dunton knew Frank
could not be trifled with when he was aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, very well!” said the actor, with an effort to be
mildly sarcastic. “I presume you will walk in here and
take the young lady away from me without her consent?
It is barely possible she may have something to say
about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” admitted Frank, “and I propose to let her say
it, but still I am sure she will permit me to see her safely
home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl arose at once, but just then two waiters came
hurrying up, demanding to know what the trouble was
about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No trouble at all,” assured Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what are you doing bothering this gent and
lady?” growled one of the waiters, who looked like a
bouncer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not look at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you come with me, miss?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that beats!” gasped the bouncer. “He’s tryin’
ter take the gent’s lady frien’ away from him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“T’row him out!” suggested the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Now Frank paid some attention to the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t attempt to put your hands on me!” he said,
grimly. “If you do, I shall knock you down!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ho! ho!” laughed the bouncer. “Out yer goes,
freshy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He endeavored to catch hold of Merry to run him for
the door, and the other offered assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smash! crack!—two blows stretched one of the waiters
on the floor and sent the other flying over the top of a
table.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl seemed overcome with terror, but Merry politely
offered his arm, calmly saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you will accept my protection, I will see you home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She took his arm, and they started toward the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this had happened so suddenly that the other patrons
of the place scarcely seemed aware there was any trouble
before the waiters had been knocked down and Frank
was leaving with the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Uttering furious exclamations, the waiters scrambled
up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give it to him!” snarled the bouncer, starting after
Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, strangely enough, Douglas Dunton thrust out his
foot, and the man tripped over it, going down with a
crash. The other waiter was following him closely, and
he went sprawling over his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton made haste to skip out by a side door, not even
stopping to pay his bill. The waiters saw him escaping,
and, remembering he had not paid, they turned after him,
giving Merry an opportunity to get away without further
molestation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>A LIVELY NIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Entirely unaware that he had been saved from a second
attack from the waiters by Dunton’s action, Frank lost no
time in leaving the place, the girl clinging to his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was so badly frightened when the street was
reached that it was some time before she could tell where
she lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had walked some distance, Frank said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss, I hope you will pardon me for interfering as I
did, but I could not help it when I saw Dunton inducing
you to drink wine. I read innocence in your face. I
knew you were out of your element in that place and
among the frequenters of it, and I resolved to save you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but, the gentleman I was with, Mr. Dunton, is
one of your company, Mr. Merriwell,” faltered the frightened
and bewildered girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am well aware of that, and that was one reason why
I was all the more determined to save you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he seemed like a nice fellow. Of course I did not
admire him as I do you, Mr. Merriwell, but he was so
pleasant, so jolly, so kind!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t a doubt of it. That made him all the more
dangerous. I saw you talking with him when I entered
the theater this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, did you!” she exclaimed. “Why, I didn’t think
you noticed me at all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I did, and I had a talk with Dunton about you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“About me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goodness! I was not aware I was so important!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“I talked to him plainly, and I fancied my words had
some impression. I was astonished when I saw you entering
that place in company with him to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mr. Merriwell!” cried the girl, in confusion; “is
that a bad place? I didn’t know. I never was in there
before! I didn’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe that is the truth, for you did not seem at all
at home in the place. I noticed that while watching you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dunton said it was a respectable restaurant, and
he was so kind to ask me to have a little lunch with him,
and he seemed so much like a perfect gentleman, and I
didn’t like to refuse, and you did not even give me a look
this afternoon, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, there! You have explained it all. I understand
it perfectly, my dear Miss—Miss——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dow—Dora Dow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dora?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of the notes I received to-day was signed Dora.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I wrote it,” confessed the girl, greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you didn’t wear—the—the ribbon I sent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you did not want to know me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear girl, I did not believe I would be doing right
to encourage you in your folly. It is plain you have some
very mistaken ideas in your little head. You said you
thought actors perfectly lovely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some actors may be, but it is not safe for you to think
them all so, and, above all things, it is not safe for you to
make the acquaintance of actors as you made that of
Douglas Dunton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there’s—there’s no other way to become acquainted
with them, is there, Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“I fancy you will be better off if you do not know
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must know them! How can I ever get onto the
stage unless I do? Now, tell me that, Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Miss Dow, is it absolutely necessary for you
to go on the stage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know that it’s absolutely necessary, but I want
to do so. It must be just perfectly lovely to play parts
and sing and get flowers and wear diamonds!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is how it seems to you. You know nothing of
the work and worry of the life, nothing of its uncertainties,
its privations. You see the actors dancing and singing
and being merry before the footlights, and it seems
‘perfectly lovely.’ You may not know that in hundreds of
cases the actresses send themselves the flowers they receive.
Their diamonds glitter, but stage diamonds are
paste, as a rule. I have no time to tell you all about the
hollow mockeries of the life, but I have an opportunity to
warn you, if you have a home, to stick by your home, and
forever give up the notion of becoming an actress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl pouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t like you, Mr. Merriwell!” she cried. “I
didn’t think you, an actor, would talk like that! That is
the way papa talks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your father is right. Listen to him. I believe you
said in your note that your mother is dead?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is most unfortunate. Just now you need a
mother to look out for you. But you have a home. If
you were to become an actress, it is probable you would
not have a home. Six months in the year, perhaps, or
even more, you might be searching for an engagement,
living as best you could during that time, uncertain as to
the future. You would be the prey of sharks and sharpers,
you would be bullied and cheated, you might get out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>with a company and be left stranded and penniless a thousand
miles from anywhere. Your sensitive nature would
revolt against mankind and the world. All your finer
nature would be ruined. Then you would do one of two
things. You would end it all by taking your own life, or
you would turn about and prey upon men, sinking lower
and lower, traveling the road to destruction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl shuddered and cried out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” she gasped. “I can’t believe anything so horrible
would happen to me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has happened to thousands before you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I—I thought——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That all actresses were happy and prosperous—that
they lived lives of ease and pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it seemed that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I dare say you thought it an easy thing to become
an actress?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seemed so,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you ever stop to think if you had any special
qualification for becoming an actress?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I thought I was rather—rather——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pretty?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she admitted, in great confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And did you think that the only requirement for becoming
an actress?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, of course not, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The girl who can act, who has real dramatic ability, is
fortunate if she is pretty. That is absolutely true. It requires
great talent for a homely girl to win success on
the stage. At the same time, a girl who is merely pretty
has almost absolutely no show unless she has dramatic
ability to some extent, or can sing in a manner to command
attention. Are you a fine singer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can sing a little.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little will not do. Keep off the stage, Miss Dow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Avoid actors. Do not flirt with them. You know nothing
about them. They may be honorable men, and they may
not be. The chances are that they are not. They are
here to-day and gone to-morrow. They live lives which
tend to rob them of their fine sense of honor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl was silent some moments, as they walked
along. At last she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell, I believe you have told me the truth.
I have refused to believe others who have told me things
about the stage and actors, but you are an actor, and you
know what you are talking about. I realize now that I
was very foolish to-night. Oh, I’ll get a scolding from
papa, for he told me I could not go to the theater, and I
ran away to go, just to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She seemed on the verge of tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If your father scolds to-night, do not answer him
saucily,” advised Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can I tell him? He will want to know where I
have been.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear girl, the best thing you can do is to tell him
the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She gasped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d never, never, never dare do that! He would be
furious!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you must not ask me what to tell him. I can
give you no other advice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again she was silent some moments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The exclamation burst from the girl’s lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell,” she said, “I am going to tell papa
just what has happened, no matter how angry he may be.
I’ll tell him all about the good advice you have given me,
and I’ll also tell him that I mean to heed it. No matter
what happens, I am going to tell the truth to-night! That
is settled!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Bravo, little girl!” exclaimed Merry, in great satisfaction.
“I do not believe you will be sorry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They turned down a street, and the girl stopped before
they had gone far.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I live just a few doors below,” she said. “I don’t
think you had better go further. Mr. Merriwell—I—I
don’t know how to say it, but I want to—to thank you.
You have been awfully kind to me, and I appreciate it.
You are just as brave as I believed you were, for you
were not a bit afraid of those two waiters in the restaurant,
and you handled them so easily! No matter what
you have said about actors I shall always know there is
one who is brave, noble and honorable! I shall not forget
you, Mr. Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her voice trembled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad to know you will remember me that way,
Miss Dow,” said Merry. “You must not understand
that I said all actors were bad. There are honorable men
who are actors, the same as there are honorable men in
other professions. The dishonorable ones, however, are
those you are most likely to meet through a chance acquaintance.
I hope you will never make the acquaintance
of any man again in such a manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—hope you do not—think too—bad—of—me,” she
murmured, hanging her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think that way of you at all,” assured Frank.
“I simply think you are like many other girls, too ready to
depend on the honor of men of whom you know absolutely
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you may come to St. Jo. again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Possibly, although it is uncertain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you have done so well here this time, and the
people liked you so much.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“I know; however, I may not be in the theatrical business
next season. I hope to return to college. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by!” she exclaimed, impulsively. “I wish you all
the success you deserve, and that is good fortune in
everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took her hand. Then she turned away quickly,
and he watched her till she had ascended the steps to
her home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was satisfied. No matter what came out of the
affair between himself and Dunton, he felt that he had
done right. Thinking it all over, he walked onward
swiftly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he stopped and looked around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Jove!” he muttered. “I believe I have lost my
way! I do not remember passing through this quarter
of the city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He walked on slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll meet a policeman pretty soon,” he thought, “and
I’ll ask him to direct me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the section of the city seemed to grow still worse
as he advanced. Almost before he was aware of it,
he found himself near the water front.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’m clean off my trolley!” he muttered, turning
back.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pretty soon he came to a street where lights shone from
windows here and there, and there were sounds of
laughter and music issuing from some of the rather
disreputable-looking buildings. Women flitted along the
street, sometimes accompanied by men, sometimes alone.
One of them, quite alone, stopped Merry, grasped him by
the arm, peered into his face, and brokenly asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you seen her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>By the light that shone from a window, Frank saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>that the woman was at least fifty years old and dressed
in a fairly respectable manner. She seemed greatly excited,
and she was trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whom do you mean, madam?” asked Frank, respectfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child—my little girl!” answered the woman. “She
is here somewhere in this city! I don’t know where! I
can’t find her! Oh Heaven! I can’t find her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have lost your daughter?” questioned Frank,
with a thrill of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes! Have you seen her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How should I know her if I saw her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman seemed dazed. She put her hand to her
head, as if trying to think. Frank could see she was
nearly distracted with grief. Her eyes were red from
weeping and her care-lined face still wet with tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know! Oh, I don’t know how to find her!
The only way is to ask somebody—anybody. I thought
I would ask the men whom I met on the street to-night,
hoping some of them might be able to tell me something
about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry, madam, but I’m afraid I can tell
you nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A despairing moan issued from the woman’s lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I followed her as soon as possible,” she said. “She
ran away from home and came here to this city. She has
been here before, and the city has ruined her. Her head
is filled with false notions! Oh, I fear I shall not find my
little girl again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cheer up, madam. Have you applied to the police?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no; not yet! I didn’t want to do that. Daisy is
so proud—so spirited! She would be awfully angry if I
were to put the police after her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is her name.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Daisy Blaney?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman gave a scream and caught hold of him with
wonderful strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have seen her? You know her? You can tell
me where she is?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is your daughter’s name, I have seen her and
had a talk with her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is she—where is she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman was so excited that she fairly choked
over the words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t tell me that!” the distracted mother screamed.
“You must know!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I give you my word of honor that I do not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did you see her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shortly after noon to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Near the Crawford Theater.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was she doing there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not wish to tell that she had spoken to him.
He said he did not know, and, in a clever manner, explained
how he had talked with her, without telling how
it came about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor Daisy! My little Daisy!” sobbed the woman.
“She did not tell you the whole truth. She is not stopping
with her friends here now. Her father was rather harsh
with her, but he is ready enough to take her back. I
followed her as soon as I could, but I have hunted, hunted,
hunted—all in vain. Oh, I must find her! Can’t you
help me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My good woman, the best thing you can do is to get
some rest to-night and look for your daughter to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rest! Do you think I can rest while my little girl is
adrift in this wicked city? No, no! I shall never rest
again till I find her!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>In vain Frank urged her, seeing that she was almost
utterly worn out. She would not listen to him. She made
him promise he would tell Daisy if he saw her that her
mother was there searching everywhere for her. And
then, all at once, the woman cried out that she must be
searching, searching, and away she went.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she was gone, Frank realized he had not found
where she was stopping, or how he could communicate
with her if he happened to meet Daisy again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it isn’t likely I’ll see the girl again,” he muttered,
walking on. “We leave the city early to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting with the unfortunate woman had driven
the feeling of satisfaction from him. He could not forget
her and her saddened, tear-wet face. He was haunted by
thoughts of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came to a large building, in front of which hung
a lighted, transparent sign, which read:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em class='gesperrt'>THE JOLLY CLUB.</em></div>
    <div><span class='small'>DANCE TO-NIGHT.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sound of music came from the open windows far
above his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he paused a moment and glanced upward, he heard
a laugh that gave him a start. He had heard that mocking
laughter before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Daisy Blaney!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a moment Frank had formed a resolution. He
would find the girl if she were in the dance hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank ascended the stairs, learned that he could obtain
admission for fifty cents, paid the money and entered
the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>A waltz was in progress, and the floor was covered
with gliding, whirling couples. As Frank had expected,
the patrons of the dance were of the lower order of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>society, although there seemed to be some semirespectable
people on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry looked around for the girl whom he sought,
and, to his intense satisfaction, it was not long before
he discovered her. She was waltzing with a tall, red-headed
young man, who looked like a would-be tough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank kept watch of her, and when the waltz was over
he saw her disappear with her partner into an adjoining
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found this room was where “refreshments” were
served. In this case the “refreshments” seemed to consist
mainly of beer, which the thirsty couples consumed at
little tables.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daisy and her partner were seated at a table, and
Frank walked past, hoping she would notice him. She
did, and instantly she uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank Merriwell!” she cried, starting up. “What are
you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Blaney,” said Frank, stopping and lifting his
hat in the most respectful manner, fully aware that the
red-headed youth was glaring at him in a savage manner.
“I was looking for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For me?” gasped the girl, in still greater astonishment.
“Now you are chucking a jolly at me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then come sit down. Mr. Merriwell, this is a friend
of mine, Mr. Gallagher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank acknowledged the introduction by a bow, and
“Mr. Gallagher” growled something in his throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daisy urged him to sit down, but Frank did not fancy
taking a seat in that place. However, in order to get
an opportunity to talk with her, he finally seated himself,
to the disgust of the youth with the red hair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Wot’ll yer have?” demanded a waiter, appearing at
Frank’s elbow the moment he was seated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may bring me a sarsaparilla,” said Merry, “and
serve Miss Blaney and Mr. Gallagher whatever they
choose to order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sarsaparilla!” shouted the girl, with a laugh. “Oh,
say, Merry, old fellow, have a beer! Babies drink soft
stuff!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I think you’ll have to class me with the babies,”
said Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Excuse me,” growled Gallagher, rising. “I don’t
drink wid chaps that goozle that kind of stuff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he walked away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry was satisfied to have the fellow depart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moment Gallagher was gone, Daisy’s manner
changed, and she swiftly said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What made you come here? You are in danger!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Danger?” exclaimed Frank, astonished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon as I left you to-day, some men came up to me
and asked me if I knew you. I chucked a bluff that you
were a particular friend of mine. Then they offered me
twenty-five dollars to decoy you into a dive where they
could knock the stuffing out of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is interesting!” commented Merry, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Both those chaps are here to-night!” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still more interesting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better get out right away. There are some
scrappers here, and you wouldn’t stand a ghost of a show
if they spotted you, and tried to lay you out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must go with me, when I go, Miss Blaney.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“I must? What for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your mother is in St. Jo. searching for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My mother?” cried the girl, astounded. “Oh, come
off your perch! What are you giving me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The truth. I met her a short time ago. She is nearly
crazy, and she’s wandering up and down the streets to-night,
searching for you, stopping every man and asking
if he has seen you. She stopped me, and that was how
I knew she was here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl turned pale for all of the paint on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heavens!” she gasped. “I didn’t think for a minute
she would do such a thing! My mother wandering about
the streets of this city to-night! It’s awful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s yer drinks,” said the waiter, as he placed the
glasses before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want anything more,” said the girl, rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But der drinks were ordered, an’ dey’ll have ter be
paid fer,” declared the man, in an ugly manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is your pay,” said Frank, flinging down a piece
of money. “Come, Miss Blaney; we’ll try to find your
mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They started to leave the room, but before they had
crossed the floor three men appeared in the doorway.
Mr. Gallagher was one of them, and he pointed at Frank,
saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dere’s yer meat, gents!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The others were Lester Vance and Reginald, the blackmailer!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those are the men who wanted me to decoy you
into a dive!” whispered Daisy Blaney, in great alarm.
“You are in a bad scrape, Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Both the rascals uttered exclamations of satisfaction on
seeing Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got him!” cried Vance, triumphantly. “Let’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>fix him so he’ll not be pretty enough to play the hero on
the stage again for a month!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we’ll fix him!” laughed the other man, showing
his teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll be easy,” sneered Gallagher. “He drinks sarsaparilla!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the two men sprang at Frank, crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spotter! Fly cop! Spy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>That cry was enough to create a sensation in the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry met their assault, and he quickly got a crack
at Vance that sent the fellow spinning.</p>

<p class='c007'>A hot fight ensued, but Frank was more than a match
for the two men. He seemed to avoid their worst blows,
and the way he got back at them filled Daisy Blaney
with unutterable satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, he’s a bird, Gallagher, if he does drink sarsaparilla!”
she cried. “He can eat you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>That infuriated the red-headed fellow, and he plunged
into the conflict. He took Frank by surprise, and got in
a blow that staggered Merry for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dat fresh eat me!” howled Gallagher. “Well, I
guess nit. He’s a soft t’ing, an’ I can do him wid me
hands tied behind——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then Frank got at Mr. Gallagher. He feinted,
leading the fellow to lift his guard, and then Merry drove
in a sledge-hammer blow over the heart that caused the
red-headed chap to collapse and lay gasping and groaning
on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible Frank would have come off with flying
colors, but the men had been given the impression that
he was a spotter or spy who had been sent there for the
purpose of making the club trouble, and now at least a
dozen persons sailed into him. Before such an onslaught
he was unable to stand. He was beaten to his knees, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>he would have been trampled under their feet in a few
seconds more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then it was that a woman literally tore her way into
the heart of the crowd, pushed and beat them back from
Frank, and stood over him with a small revolver in her
hand, screaming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cowards! Are there no real men among you? Back!
This gun is loaded, and, by Heaven! I’ll shoot the first
one who tries to touch him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Queen Mab!” exclaimed several, and they fell
back before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank staggered to his feet. One look he took at the
woman, and he saw she was the one who had sought to
aid in blackmailing him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is no spotter,” she declared. “He is Frank Merriwell,
the actor who is playing at the Crawford. I
suppose he came in here to enjoy himself, the same as
any man may. He has behaved himself, and this brutal
assault is an outrage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mab!” cried a shaking voice, and the man who had
claimed to be her husband forced his way forward, his
face bruised and cut and bleeding from the blows he
had received, “have you gone crazy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” she shouted back. “But I’ve seen enough of
this! Shame on you, Reg, to try to get revenge like this
just because he was too sharp to bite your bait! As for
that fellow who planned the job, he’s a cheap actor who
was kicked out of Merriwell’s company, and he has been
trying to do something to get revenge. I’m disgusted
with him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed that the woman was well known there, and
her words carried some weight. It was useless for the
man to protest, she showed her scorn for him and expressed
her admiration for Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s going out of here!” she declared, “and not another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>one of you will lift a hand against him! I’ll shoot
the dog that tries it. I promise you that, and you know
Queen Mab always keeps her promises.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What she says goes,” declared a man. “You may as
well let the young fellow alone. She’ll take him out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not going without Daisy Blaney,” muttered
Frank, looking round. “Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Daisy was found, and the three moved toward the
door. No one offered to stop or molest them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the street was reached, the woman stopped and
put up her revolver. She laughed a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather admired you this morning, Mr. Merriwell,”
she said. “I found you were too shrewd to be caught in
such a trap as we had set for you. But more than ever I
admire you now since I have seen you fight a dozen men
and nearly prove a match for them all. You are all
right, my boy, and you’ll not be troubled again by Queen
Mab.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, before Frank could say a word, she whirled
about and ran back into the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were standing there in the light from the doorway
when there came a cry, and a woman came running
up, flinging her arms about the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy!” she screamed. “My child, I have found
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother!” exclaimed the girl, putting her arms round
the aged woman and supporting her. “Mr. Merriwell
found me and told me you were here, searching for me.
Oh, mother, mother! I am so sorry!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman was crying. Between her sobs, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy, you will—go back—home? Father is—sorry!
He’ll forgive and—forget, if you’ll—come back. I have
been distracted! You—you’ll kill me if you don’t—come
home! Won’t you come?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Yes, mother,” said the girl, now breaking into tears,
“I’ll come home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” uttered Frank Merriwell, “this has been a
rather lively night, but it has turned out most satisfactory
in all ways.”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell,” said Dunton, the following day, “I don’t
remember just what I said in that restaurant last night,
for I was pretty angry with you. I have been thinking
it over since, and I’m rather glad you did just what you
did. That little girl was altogether too unsophisticated.
I don’t hold any hard feelings, and I hope you’ll forget
anything I shot at you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right,” assured Frank. “It’s rather awkward
for either of us to speak about the matter, and I’m
glad you were the one to mention it. But let such girls
alone, Dunton. The world is bad enough, and women
have reasons enough for thinking men deceivers and villains.
You’ll find you’ll feel better if you do your best
to make them think they have made a mistake in judging
the sterner sex.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you are right about that,” confessed Dunton.
“I believe I have learned a lesson.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A MISSOURI TERROR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Merriwell shot out the first and last words; a
local sceneshifter and stage hand of the Wilcoxson Opera
House asked the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several days had elapsed and Merriwell’s company
had reached Carrolton, Missouri, and Frank was watching
the men who were bringing the special scenery for
“True Blue” onto the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The local stage hands were assisting in this work, and
one of them, a rather fresh young chap, began to tear off
some of the cleats that held the sets together. To do
this, he used a hammer, and he began knocking them
apart in a reckless manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came Frank’s command.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young fellow seemed astounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter with you?” he demanded. “We
can’t take care of this stuff in this shape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let it alone,” ordered Merry. “I’ll have somebody
look out for that who knows how to do it without staving
it to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do ye suppose I’m hired for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not hired to smash my scenery. If you are,
I’ll not allow it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your scenery!” sneered the fellow, who did not know
Merry, and fancied he might be the property man of
the company, as he was a beardless youth. “Why, you
talk as if you owned the old show! You make me tired!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Some chaps like to show off when they get a little authority,
and I reckon you’re one of that kind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank made no retort to these insolent words, but his
jaws squared a bit and there came to his eyes a look
which the fellow would have known was dangerous
had he been better acquainted with Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The local stage hand fancied he had settled the matter
by giving the presumptuous “property man” a call down,
and he now went at the scenery again, smashing at the
cleats with the hammer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not strike more than a single blow, for, with a
spring, Frank had him by the collar.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a moment, Merry took the hammer from the surprised
chap’s hand, and flung it far away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here! what the——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow whirled about and struck at Frank, but
he was sent spinning to one side, to fall sprawling over
some properties.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t try it again,” calmly advised Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The astounded stage hand scrambled up, snarling with
anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m Joe Hooker!” he cried. “And I can do up anything
in this town. I’ll have to smash ye for that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you know what is real healthy for you, Joe
Hooker,” said Frank, with a grim smile, “you’ll keep
your distance and let this scenery alone. You’re too
fresh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re the one that’s fresh, you two-cent property
man!” howled the wrathy fellow. “You think you own
the whole show, but I’ll knock some of the conceit outer
your head!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a furious rush at Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apparently Frank had no thought of getting out of
the way, but, at the moment when Hooker struck out
with his open hand, thinking to give Merry a slap that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>would set his head ringing, if it did not upset him, the
young actor leaped aside, ducking the swinging blow,
caught his assailant by the collar and a handy portion
of his trousers, and ran him off the stage, shooting him
down a flight of stairs, at the bottom of which he fell
sprawling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim Gallup came round just in time to witness
this, and he stood laughing heartily, his hands on his
hips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gol-darn ef I don’t believe he kainder thinks he
struck somethin’ all-fired decepshus, Frank!” chuckled the
Vermont youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Billy Wynne, the property man, had also seen the
finish of the encounter, and he was highly amused.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a scrambling sound on the stairs, and, a
moment later, Joe Hooker, his face flaming red, came
scrambling and panting to the top, revenge gleaming in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drat ye!” he snarled. “Ye didn’t do that fair! You
don’t ’mount ter shucks, and I can paralyze ye in a
fair fight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not here to fight,” Merry laughed. “I am minding
my own business, and, if you know when you are
well off, you will do the same. If you don’t, you may get
hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank’s laughter irritated the chap more than anything
else. Again he made a rush, but this time it was with
the intention of smashing Frank without delay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Frank wished to avoid a fight, if possible, and he
easily dodged in time to avoid the fellow’s rush.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gallup shouted:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yeou darn fool! Yeou don’t know who yeou’re gittin’
up ag’inst! You’ll be etarnally chawed up fust thing
yeou know!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>But the furious stage hand did not heed, if he heard.
He wheeled and came at Merry again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was beginning to get tired of this. He did not
wish to strike the fellow, and yet he could not keep up
the dodging.</p>

<p class='c007'>The curtain had been raised to let light in onto the
stage while the scenery was being brought in and arranged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once more Merry managed to avoid the rush of the
angry chap, although he was barely able to do so, as now
the fellow was watching for him to dodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>This dodging made Hooker all the more confident, for
he thought Frank did not dare stand up and meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This time, however, Frank stepped back as the belligerent
stage hand plunged past him, unable to stop his
rush when Frank had dodged, and quickly grabbing
him, flung him clean out over the proscenium and footlights,
so he struck sprawling between the front row of
seats and the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>This handling astounded Hooker, who could not understand
it at all. He jumped up and started to leap back
onto the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The local stage manager had appeared in time to witness
the manner in which Frank handled Hooker, and
now he shouted:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Joe, what’s up?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That dratted property man’s meddlin’ with me!”
snarled Hooker. “I’ll eat him if he’ll stop dodging!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Property man!” cried the stage manager. “Why,
you’re daffy! That’s Frank Merriwell, the owner of the
show!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hooker was astounded. He had reached the stage
again, and he stopped in a half-stooping posture, staring
at Merry, his under jaw drooping.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Him the owner of the show?” he ejaculated, in evident
doubt. “Ye’re kidding, Sawyer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I am not,” assured the local stage manager.
“What’s all this about, anyhow? What’s he been doing,
Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He started to tear apart some of the scenery here,
and I told him to let it alone, but he was not inclined to
do so. When I stopped him he attacked me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ he faound himself up ag’inst a feller that kin eat
Hookers ez fast ez they kin walk up,” laughed Ephraim
Gallup. “There ain’t enough Hookers in Mizzury to
bother Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that so?” sneered the stage hand. “My brother
Sam can clean out this whole show. He’s just home from
New Mexico, and there ain’t anybody in this town wants
to tackle him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yeour brother Sam would be pie for Frank Merriwell,”
asserted Ephraim. “Ef he knows when he’s well
off, he’ll mind his own business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By hocus, we’ll see,” shouted Hooker. “He don’t
’low anybody to meddle with me, and I’ll just bring him
round here. He’ll make things sizzle!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow started for the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going?” demanded Frank, sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After Sam, by thunder!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not handle your brother in the same gentle
manner that I handled you, in case he comes here and
attempts to make trouble. You know you were wrong,
so you had better drop it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, Joe,” said the local stage manager,
anxiously. “What’s the use to kick up a fuss over it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think I’m going to stand this kind of treatment?”
snarled Joe. “I’m no fool! I’ll be back pretty soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Then he ran off the stage and down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stage manager looked frightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better leave right away, Mr. Merriwell,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What if he does?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“His brother’s a pirate! He’s a big fellow, and a
regular ruffian. He’s been in half a dozen fights since
he got home, a week ago. He killed a man in a fight
before he left for New Mexico, two years ago, and
that was why he got out of here. They ain’t dared
try to arrest him sense he come back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that’s pretty interesting!” commented Frank,
with a slight show of scorn. “So the law-abiding citizens
of Carrolton permit the ruffian to run things just
as he pleases?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s strange.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s armed. He carries two pistols all the time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he can shoot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He went into a saloon the night he got home and
shot the necks off all the bottles in sight, ending by
shooting out the lights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And nobody arrested him for that trick? Well, this
fellow must be regarded as a bad man from Bitter
Creek.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what he calls himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think he needs to be curried down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There ain’t nobody here dares tackle the job. He
gets drunk and shoots out windows in houses, and has
a great time.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“I should think they’d bind him over to keep the
peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They don’t want to try it. He’s going back to New
Mexico pretty soon, and as long as he don’t do any
great damage they’ll keep still while he’s here and pray
for him to go. He’ll be furious when he hears Joe’s
story. There’ll be the dickens to pay!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t like to have trouble with anybody,”
admitted Frank, with a slight show of regret; “but I
couldn’t let that young fellow smash up my scenery.
Why do you have him round the theater?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a good worker, and the managers are the ones
who hire him. I don’t have anything to do with that.
You had better go away, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go away?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, before he comes back with Sam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So they will not find you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What? Do you want me to run away? Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be a discreet thing for you to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And cowardly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nobody is regarded as a coward for trying to avoid
trouble with Sam Hooker. People say anybody who
won’t get out of the way and let him alone is a fool.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not run away from Mr. Hooker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remember he carries pistols.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t make any difference if he carries cannons.
Go ahead with the work of putting in my scenery. I
shall stay here till the last piece is in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right, Frank,” said Ephraim; “but there
ain’t no need of yeou gittin’ chawed up by this pirut. I
an’ Wynne’ll stay here ter look aout fer the stuff, an’
yeou better go to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank regarded Gallup with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Well, by Jove!” he exclaimed. “That beats! I
didn’t think I’d hear anything like that from you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Vermonter reddened a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darn it!” he cried. “There ain’t no reason why yeou
shouldn’t be keerful. That ain’t bein’ a coward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not,” hastily put in Sawyer, the local
stage manager. “Didn’t I tell you nobody is regarded
as cowardly for attempting to avoid trouble with Sam
Hooker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, I should feel that I was running away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s better than having your head broken. If you
stay here and wait for Sam Hooker, you won’t play to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it. He’ll put you out of shape. They say
he knocked down old Dorman’s bull with one blow of
his fist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have heard of such things being done,” said Frank,
still without showing alarm; “but I’ve never happened to
see anybody do it yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know he broke one of Mose Herrick’s ribs with
a blow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I shall do my best not to let Mr. Sam Hooker
hit me in that manner. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you do your best, you will get out and go to the
hotel. If he comes there you’ll have somebody tell him
you have gone somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just keep that stage door wide open,” he directed.
“I threw Joe Hooker down those stairs, and it may happen
that his brother will take the same sort of tumble.
Go on putting the stuff in, and don’t worry about me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the work continued, although everybody but Frank
seemed anxious and nervous. Merry was perfectly cool,
and seemed to have forgotten all that had occurred and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that Joe Hooker had departed to look for his terrible
brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not much more than thirty minutes before there
was the sound of heavy feet on the stairs, and, after
taking a look down, Ephraim ran to Frank, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re comin’, by gosh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a word did Merry say, but he advanced to meet
the Hookers, buttoning his coat tightly around him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Hooker came in first, his face shining with triumph.
He was followed by a large man, who was dressed in
the rough garments of a cowboy and wore a wide-brimmed
hat, with a cartridge band round it. This fellow
had a flushed face and reddish eyes. He did look
decidedly savage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherever is this yar kay-o-te?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right there!” cried Joe, pointing at Frank Merriwell.
“That is the chap! He’s the one, Sam!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cowboy stopped, placed his hands on his hips,
and glared at Frank in great amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey?” he shouted. “Is that him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” assured Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ he slammed yer round?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This yar dood did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yep,” sheepishly admitted the younger brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yer must bin dreamin’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; he done it, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ he allows he kin fight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He does.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, he wouldn’t be a bite fer me. Look hyar, ef
you can’t handle that yar lily-faced chap, yer ain’t no
brother o’ mine. I reckoned yer was goin’ ter put me
up ag’in somethin’ what wuz wuth tacklin’.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Sam Hooker seemed to be on the point of turning
about and leaving, much to the relief of Ephraim and
the local stage manager.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Joe had no thought of letting the affair end like
that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t thrash him, Sam,” he said, “he’ll blow
all over town that he walloped a Hooker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll do it, sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cowboy turned and looked Frank over again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did yer slam my brother around somewhat?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your brother did not obey me when I asked him to
stop hammering at some of my scenery, and I was compelled
to handle him roughly,” admitted Frank, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did yer throw him off the stage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down ther stairs?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ yer said ye’d handle me rougher than that ef I
come round?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe I made some such remark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There!” shouted the younger brother, in delight. “I
told ye!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoop!” roared the elder. “Is this yar possible? Is
it possible a hand-fed cosset calf will blat at this untamed
old maverick in this yar manner? I reckon I’m dreamin’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s jest what he done, Sam,” declared the younger
brother, eagerly. “He thinks he can do you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, I reckon I’ll hev ter wipe up ther floor with
him, jest ter teach ther blame fool a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whereupon the cowboy spat on his hands and prepared
to attack Merriwell, at whom he glared in a manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>that expressed his contempt for such an insignificant
person.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim Gallup stood near, his mouth wide open and
his knees seeming to shake beneath him. The aspect of
the cowboy was so terrible that the Vermonter actually
seemed frightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sawyer, the local stage manager, was also frightened,
but he did not dare interfere, for he stood in great fear
of Sam Hooker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s too bad!” he said, in an aside to Billy Wynne.
“There won’t be any show to-night, unless Mr. Merriwell
has an understudy. Sam Hooker will stave him all
up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps so,” said Wynne. “But Frank Merriwell is
quite a scrapper when he is forced to fight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll be a baby in Sam Hooker’s hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no use hoping. He’s done for! Too bad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are ye reddy, tenderfoot dood?” shouted the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I warn you again to keep away and let me alone,”
said Frank, grimly. “I do not wish to fight with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To be course ye don’t! Haw! haw! Ye’d be a fool
ef ye did! But ye’ve made some loose talk, so that
I’ve gotter chaw ye up. Be ye reddy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank stood with his hands at his sides, his eyes watching
every motion of the ruffian. He seemed perfectly
careless and unprepared, but, in fact, he was quite ready
for anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam Hooker took a step forward, but paused in astonishment
when Frank did not cower or attempt to run
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give it to him!” urged Joe, who seemed anxious to
“get even” with the youth who had handled him so easily.
“He’s a dodger! Look out for him!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“He won’t be able to do no dodgin’ when I’m done
with him,” declared the vicious cowboy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Sawyer,” said Frank, speaking in a cool manner
to the local stage manager, “please hold the door wide
open, so I can throw this ruffian downstairs without
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam Hooker gasped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do my ears hear straight?” he gasped. “Throw me
downstairs! What—that? Waal, may I be jiggered!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with a roar, he made a leap at Frank.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE DOWNFALL OF SAM HOOKER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To the astonishment of Joe Hooker, Frank Merriwell
did not attempt to dodge. Instead, with a sweep of one
arm, he knocked Sam Hooker’s hands aside, and then
planted a blow on the cowboy’s chin. It was a swinging
uppercut, and it literally lifted the ruffian off his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head and shoulders of the man struck the floor
before any other part of his body. Barely had he dropped
when the young actor was on him, grasping him by the
collar and slack of his trousers. With a jerk, Frank
brought the man up, ran him to the door, and gave him
a thrust. Then, at the very head of the flight of stairs,
Merry lifted Sam Hooker with a terrible kick.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man actually seemed to turn over and over in the
air, and he struck at the bottom of the stairs with a
thud that shook the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Hooker gave a shout of rage, and he was on
Frank just as Merry delivered that kick. It was too
late for him to aid his brother, but he knocked Frank
against the wall, and then tried to clutch him by the
throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Right there Ephraim Gallup “got into gear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on, ye crooked critter!” he shouted. “Yeou
can’t do that when I’m araound, by thutteration!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He caught hold of Joe Hooker and gave him a yank
backward.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a moment Merriwell had recovered from the surprise
of the sudden attack, and he also had hold of the
cowboy’s younger brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me have him, Ephraim!” he grimly commanded.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“I don’t want him,” confessed Gallup, as he relaxed
his hold on Frank’s assailant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry whirled Joe toward the door, and, a moment
later, the fellow went sailing downstairs after his brother,
on top of whom he landed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam Hooker, stunned and bewildered, was just crawling
to his feet when Joe came flying through the air,
striking on his shoulders. The cowboy was hurled to
the floor again by the crushing weight of his brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was not seriously hurt, as his fall had been broken,
but Sam lay still and groaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe sat up and looked at his brother, whom he had
regarded as mighty and invincible. Sam opened his eyes
after a little and looked at Joe. It was several moments
before either of them spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are ye hurt much?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno,” grunted Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Feel any pain?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno,” grunted Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they were silent several moments, still staring
at each other. At last, Sam ventured to speak again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What done it?” he inquired. “Was there an earthquake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You went up to lick a dude for me,” explained Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did I?” murmured the cowboy. “I’m ruther muddled.
Where’s the dude?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Up there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ we’re down here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sing’lar!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again they were silent, while the cowboy seemed trying
to collect his thoughts, plainly no easy matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did I do to the dude?” he finally asked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“Nothing,” answered Joe, dolefully. “He did it to
you. He kicked you clean down the stairs, and then
threw me after ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam made a frantic struggle and sat up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look hyar, Joe!” he growled; “don’t tell me a lie,
fer I’ll wallop yer ef yer do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That ain’t no lie,” declared Joe. “He done it, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t ask me! I reckoned you’d chew him up,
but he seemed to handle you easier than he did me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, thar ain’t no galoot in this yar town kin handle
me!” growled the cowboy, making a desperate struggle
to rise.</p>

<p class='c007'>He grew dizzy and toppled over. Then Joe assisted
him to his feet, but he stood there in a bewildered way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never felt so queer in all my life,” he muttered.
“The wind seems all knocked out of me. I think I need
a drink to brace me up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do to the dude?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think I’ll do a thing ter him now, but I reckon
I’ll settle with him later. I’ll shoot him full of holes like
a sieve! I’ll smash him like a fly! I’ll rope him like a—steer!
I’ll brand him like a calf!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe seemed greatly disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I allow you made some talk like this before we came
here,” he said; “but the dude kicked you down the stairs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wasn’t ready for him. I wasn’t expecting him to
move so quick. He took me off my guard. Ef he’d
seemed at all dangerous, I’d been watchin’ out. But I’ll
do him! He’ll never play in his old show ter-night! I
promise you that, Joe. I’ll fix him so he won’t be able
ter walk acrost ther stage!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that threat, the cowboy staggered out of the
building, aided by Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe landed in a heap on Sam, Sawyer, the stage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>manager, stared at Frank Merriwell in wonder and
admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did ye do it?” he muttered. “Why, Sam
Hooker didn’t seem to bother you no more’n his brother
Joe, and both of ’em was pie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haw! haw! haw!” roared Ephraim Gallup, slapping
his thigh. “I did think that big feller was dangerous,
but he was disposed of so gol-darn easy that it was over
before I knowed it hed begun.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he is the terror of the town!” gurgled Sawyer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When he come up here, I ruther thought I’d like to
be to hum on the farm, b’gosh!” confessed Ephraim;
“but now I wouldn’t hev missed it fer a hull acre of
pertaturs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell is a noted amateur athlete,” said Billy
Wynne, speaking to Sawyer. “But he never boasts about
it, and we, the members of his company, are just beginning
to find it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the stage manager, “I’m glad he was
able to handle Sam Hooker, but I wish he’d done the
feller up so he couldn’t make any more trouble. He’ll
try to get revenge, see if he don’t. He’ll make lots of
trouble for Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He better not,” said the Vermont youth, grimly.
“The best thing he kin do is ter keep still and mind his
business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He won’t do that. Mr. Merriwell must be on the
watch for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly think Mr. Hooker is very dangerous,” smiled
Frank. “I have noticed in almost every case that bullies
are overrated. People get to thinking them very dangerous,
and thus they are able to carry on a reign of
terror till somebody takes the wind out of them. After
that they seldom amount to much. Sometimes they
degenerate so that boys can handle them. I am willing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>to prophesy that Mr. Hooker will turn out one of this
kind. As soon as it is well known that somebody has
thrashed him, he will become an object of ridicule, and
no one will have cause to fear him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if you could bring such a state of affairs about,
the whole town would owe you a vote of thanks,” declared
Sawyer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not very likely that he will molest me again,
unless, by some chance, it becomes known that he was
handled roughly this time. Then he may make a desperate
attempt to reclaim his lost reputation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you are not at all afraid of him, Mr. Merriwell?”
“Afeared of him?” exploded Ephraim Gallup. “By
gum! I ain’t never yit seen ther critter that walked
araound on two laigs that Frank Merriwell was skeered
of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this fellow is a bloodthirsty ruffian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe he is nearly as bloodthirsty as he
wishes people to believe,” said Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would you go right out of the door down there if
you knew he was waiting for you?” asked Sawyer,
doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think I would drop out of a window on the
other side of the building so he would not see me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but it don’t seem to me that you know just what
kind of a man Sam Hooker is. You don’t seem to realize
that he has whipped five fighting men in a stand-up
battle. I don’t believe that kind of a man can be easily
tamed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, ding-darn it!” cried Gallup. “He never come
back to git any more arter he run ag’in Frank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And for that very reason,” said the local stage manager,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“I am inclined to believe he will lay for Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he does, he’ll git a wuss wallopin’ then he ever
guv anybody in his life. I’ll warrant him that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He made a mistake in thinking he was going to handle
Mr. Merriwell easily. Next time he will not make that
mistake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, he don’t want ter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll try to smash Mr. Merriwell at the very start.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry about that, Mr. Sawyer,” said Frank.
“Go ahead getting my stuff in. Ephraim, go to the hotel
and send Havener and Dunton here to help handle this
stuff. We must have somebody in the place of Joe
Hooker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim departed, and Frank continued to watch the
disposal of his scenery as it was brought in.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long before Havener, Dunton and Gallup
appeared. Ephraim came in fuming.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum!” he cried. “Yeou’re goin’ ter have a raow
with that feller, sure, Frank! He’s watchin’ fer ye!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hooker?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew he would!” exclaimed Sawyer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is he?” asked Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the saloon on the corner,” answered the Vermonter.
“He was peekin’ aout of the winder, an’ he jumped
aout when he saw me comin’. Soon as he saw yeou
warn’t with me, he said somethin’ kainder disgusted like
an’ went back in. There’s a reg’ler gang with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A gang?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a crowd of young toughs who follow him
around,” explained Sawyer. “They think he’s able to
whip Corbett, and they take delight in seein’ him smash
anybody.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Frank did not show the least alarm, but his face grew
grim and resolute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather fancy I shall have enough of my friends with
me to see that I get fair play,” he said. “That is all I
ask.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton got close to Frank, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can count on me, Mr. Merriwell. I believe I’d
like a chance to make myself solid with you again, for
you must have a poor opinion of me since what happened
in St. Jo.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did no more than hundreds of actors are doing
every season,” said Merry; “and you were man enough
afterward to acknowledge that you believed you were
in the wrong. I have held nothing against you, Dunton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” said the actor, simply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ephraim told us about your encounter with this ruffian,”
said Havener. “You should have broken his head
with a club.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They continued the work of arranging the scenery and
getting it ready for quick handling at night. The first
scene was set.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank told Sawyer that he wanted five men for supers,
and they must be on hand at three o’clock for instructions.
Sawyer promised to provide them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Frank prepared to leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Ephraim, who was somewhat agitated,
despite his efforts to keep cool, “there’s goin’ ter be a
dinged hot old time. Come erlong, Mr. Sawyer, if yeou
want to see ther jamboree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll follow,” said Sawyer, and it was plain that he
did not wish to be seen with the actors.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they approached the saloon on the corner a number
of men were seen loitering in front of it. One of
them darted into the saloon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Gone ter tell Hooker!” gurgled Ephraim. “Jeewhillikins!
I’m beginnin’ ter feel that I kainder wisht I was to
hum on the farm!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Next to the saloon a man was washing windows with
a hose.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the little party reached the corner, Joe Hooker
came running out, quickly followed by his brother and
several of the toughs of the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is!” cried Joe, pointing to Frank. “Now
smash him, Sam! Yeou said you would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cowboy grinned viciously as his eyes rested on
Frank. He placed himself squarely in the middle of the
sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t let him get hold of you, Merriwell!” panted
Dunton, who was pale and unsteady. “He looks like a
perfect devil!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on, hyar!” roared Sam Hooker, glaring at
Merry. “You’re ther galoot I’ve bin waitin’ fer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go for him, Sam!” cried the toughs. “Give it to the
dude show chap!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ll make mincemeat of him,” promised the ruffian,
advancing on Merry. “I’ll pulverize him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not order him to keep off, for he knew it
would be a waste of breath. Instead of that, to the
astonishment of Hooker and his gang, he went straight
at the fellow like a flash.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was a movement entirely unexpected. The cowboy
attempted to catch hold of Merry, but Frank dodged
aside, still advancing, struck the fellow a blow on the
elbow that whirled him sideways, and then gave him one
under the ear that made him stagger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paste him, Sam!” howled Joe, beginning to dance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>The ruffian whirled back, but Merriwell had followed
him closely, and the blow Hooker struck was readily
parried. Then Merry began to hammer the fellow scientifically,
following every advantage closely, and keeping
him going. Only once was Frank hit, and that was a
weak blow, for he jumped back in time to avoid the full
force of the swinging drive, which must have knocked
him down had he not made the movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Frank leaped back, the ruffian fancied things had
turned his way, and, uttering unprintable language, he
tried to close in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t let him get hold of you, Merriwell!” again
panted Dunton, who was shaking in every limb.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the astonishment of everybody, Frank paid no heed
to this, but suddenly darted inside his assailant’s guard
and grappled with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I’ve got ye!” shouted the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now Sam’ll break him!” yelled Joe Hooker, with
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then something happened that caused everybody to
open his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ruffian tried to crush the young athlete, but, by a
wrestling trick, Frank lifted him, flung his heels into the
air, snapped him over his hip, and sent him heavily to the
solid walk.</p>

<p class='c007'>These movements had carried them close to where the
man who had been washing windows in a dazed way,
with the hose in his hands, the water pouring from the
nozzle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a twinkling, Merriwell caught the hose from the
man’s hand and turned the stream on Sam Hooker, who
had risen to a sitting position.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Whar is he!” the ruffian roared. “Has he run away?
I’ll swaller——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Water!” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sizz—spat!—the stream from the hose struck Hooker
full in the mouth, drowning his words instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow was knocked flat on his back by the force
of the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps this will cool him off,” observed Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crowd of toughs began to realize what was happening
to the terror of the town, and they were astounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ther dude flammed him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sam’s met his match!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s Frank Merriwell!” cried one of the boys of the
town. “If you fellers have ever heard of him, you
oughter know he can do up all the Hookers in Missouri!
He’s a honey cooler!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Hooker was dazed, for up to this meeting he had
not realized that his bully brother had met his match in
a smooth-faced, boyish-looking actor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even now, when the realization of the truth was beginning
to force itself on Joe, he was so infuriated because
such a thing could be possible that it made him crazy.
Snarling and spitting like a wild cat, he made a spring
for Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as a flash, Frank turned the stream from Sam
Hooker to his brother. It struck Joe in the eyes, blinding
him, staggering him. It filled his mouth and forced its
way down his throat. He gurgled and choked, and then
his heel caught and he fell flat on his back.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Sam was able to sit up again, catching his
breath and rubbing the water out of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Oh, I’ll have his blood!” panted the cowboy. “This
settles him! Whar is he? Show him ter——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was trying to get out a revolver when Merry gave
it to him again, and over on his back he was knocked
once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spectators had been filled with wonder, but now
they saw the ludicrous side of the encounter, and they
began to pound each other on the back and shout with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sw’ar, it’s ther funniest thing I ever saw!” roared
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think of Sam takin’ water like that!” shouted another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s swallered enough ter p’izen him a’reddy!” declared
another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bet he ain’t hed a bath afore in a year!” exclaimed
a fourth.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then, in chorus, they roared:</p>

<p class='c007'>“A-haw! a-haw! a-haw!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim Gallup executed a grotesque dance on the
sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum! this is a reg’lar jamboree!” he giggled. “It
oughter be an advertisement fer ther show if Frank does
ther bully of ther taown up good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be the wonder of the place,” declared Sawyer,
the local stage manager. “I don’t understand it
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Douglas Dunton showed his relief. Although he had
agreed to stand by Frank, Dunton had been decidedly
frightened. Now he was beginning to laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener had not said much, but he was looking on in
great satisfaction, nodding his approval over what was
happening.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Joe Hooker sat up, but Merry was giving Sam all he
wanted just then, and he paid very little attention to Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The younger brother got onto his hands and knees, and
then sprang to his feet. He did not make more than
two steps toward Merry, however, before the stream
of water struck him in the eyes once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>This time it came unexpectedly, but Joe was not
knocked down. He reeled back, putting up his arm to
protect his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank continued to pour the water upon him. Joe
whirled back toward Merry, but the water struck him
in the back of the neck. He bent over, and the stream
beat under his coat, turning it up over his head. Then,
with his coat in that manner, Joe gave up and took to his
heels, dusting round the corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go it!” shouted the crowd, in merriment.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one had offered to help the brothers. At first no
one had imagined Sam Hooker could need help in disposing
of the boyish actor. When they began to understand
that the bully had met his match, they were so
dazed that no one made a move to help him. When the
stream of water was turned on him, the risibilities of the
rough fellows were aroused, and they shouted with laughter
over the plight of the fellow upon whom they had
gazed in fear and awe a short time before.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as a bully ceases to command respect, as soon
as he is made ridiculous, his prestige is gone. No one had
dared laugh at Sam Hooker before that. He had done the
most grotesque things without causing anybody to crack
a smile. Now, however, they literally roared with amusement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam heard them laughing. At first it infuriated him,
but that stream of cold water cooled his rage swiftly.
He got onto his hands and knees and tried to rise. The
water struck him again, sending him back to his hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and knees. That was too much. Without realizing what
a laughable spectacle he presented, he scrambled on all
fours for a place of safety. He scampered round the corner
after his brother, and Frank Merriwell was left in
possession of the field.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Permit me to return your hose to you, sir,” said
Merry, smilingly, as he gave the hose back to the man
from whom he had snatched it. “I trust you will pardon
me for my rudeness in taking it thus abruptly, but there
did not seem to be time enough to ask in a polite manner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man was holding onto his sides and shouting
with laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O-ho! o-ho! o-ho!” he bellowed. “Funniest—thing—I—ever—saw!
Oh-ho! a-haw! a-haw!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He wiped his eyes, literally gasping with laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad I was able to provide you with amusement,
sir,” said Merry, quietly. “And I trust I have
caused you no inconvenience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man suddenly grew sober.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gosh!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never thought of it before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thought of what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What Sam Hooker may think about my lettin’ you
have the hose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you didn’t let me have it. I took it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you did, but Sam may not look at it that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You fear he’ll make trouble for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he does, I’ll hunt him up and give him the worst
thrashing of his life,” said Merry, with the utmost coolness,
speaking loudly enough for the staring roughs to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>hear. “I have been very gentle with him thus far, but
the limit is reached. Next time I have trouble with him
I think I shall break his back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gosh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hear him talk!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bet he kin do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s hot stuff!”</p>

<p class='c007'>These muttered exclamations came from the lips of
the toughs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t I tell ye he could do up all the Hookers in
Missouri!” triumphantly cried the village boy. “I’ve
read all about him, and he is the warmest biscuit in the
pan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon I’d better git away afore Sam Hooker comes
back lookin’ fer me,” said the man who had been using
the hose.</p>

<p class='c007'>He shut off the water, made haste to detach the hose,
and hustled into the store, without saying another word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, gentlemen,” said Merry, speaking to his
friends. “The Hookers seem to have hooked it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he turned to the staring toughs, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it should happen that Sam Hooker wishes to see
me again, tell him to come round to the hotel and call for
me. If he hasn’t had enough, I’ll finish him next time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that he walked away, accompanied by Ephraim,
Havener and Dunton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton was breathing easier.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell,” he said, “I don’t know how you do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t half as hard as it looked,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that fellow was a most desperate-looking ruffian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He seemed pretty desperate, but there’s not much behind
his outward appearance. I saw that in the first
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“How could you see it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I will explain. He is masquerading here in
cowboy rig, and he is doing that to impress the people
of this place. He makes himself look as fierce and terrible
as possible. That is for the purpose of terrifying
people and making them stand in awe of him. He has a
way of swaggering and bragging. Now, a real desperado
seldom makes such an effort to convince people that he
is desperate. Very often it is the case that the genuine
desperado, the real dangerous man, is peaceful and mild
in appearance, seeking to avoid rather than to attract
attention. One of the most desperate ruffians the West
ever produced—Slade—was as mild-mannered as a
woman. Wild Bill, who was a ‘killer’ all his life, never
swaggered and boasted of what he could do. Jesse
James was not a boaster. I might name many others. In
nine cases out of ten, the desperado who boasts and brags,
who swaggers and tries to frighten everybody by his
terrible appearance, is a craven at heart, and he may be
handled with ease once he realizes he has met his
master.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell,” said Havener, “it is a wonder to me how
you read human character so well. Do you ever make a
mistake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes!” laughed Frank, honestly. “I have made
lots of mistakes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By trusting men who were rascals. By giving them
too much chance at me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s alwus in that way that he makes mistakes, by
thutter!” put in Gallup. “He never makes um any other
way, an’ I guess by jee! that sometimes when he does
trust a feller, he knows the chap’s crooked, but kainder
hopes he won’t prove that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Yes,” smiled Merry, “I have trusted many chaps,
while I felt in my heart that they were crooked, but I
hoped I might be mistaken. I do not like to condemn a
man before he has been given a show to display what
there is in him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunton had been walking along in silence after his
first remark. Now he observed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I rather believe that sometimes, by trusting such fellows,
you put them on their honor so that they are
ashamed to do you a dirty turn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is my object—it is my hope,” said Merry. “The
moment a man knows he is mistrusted, if his character is
weak, he begins to mistrust himself. Let him feel that
others have confidence in him, and his conscience in many
cases makes him ashamed of being crooked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t suppose I’m any too good,” admitted Dunton.
“In fact, I realize I’m not. It was not so long ago that
I tried to do you a bad turn, Merriwell. That was when
you first joined the company to which I belonged. I was
no match for you. You did me up, but then, instead of
exposing me and causing my release in disgrace from
the company, you kept still and gave me a show. When
I understood the full extent of your generosity, I began
to compare myself with you, and the comparison was
odious. I was disgusted with myself. I said, ‘Frank
Merriwell is square, white and generous. What are you?’
Then I came to you, Merriwell, and owned up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” nodded Frank. “And I do not believe
to this day Havener knows anything about it, although
he was witness of the whole affair as it originally
happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew there was some trouble between you and Dunton,”
said the stage manager, “and I saw that it came out
all right, for both of you dropped all hard feelings, or
seemed to.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“But you never knew,” said Dunton, “that I tried to
kill Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kill him?” gasped Havener.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great gosh!” gurgled Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” admitted the stage manager, “I never knew
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’s a fact,” admitted the actor. “It was in the
time when we were playing in repertoire just after the
wind up of poor old ‘Uncle Tom.’ You remember that
Merriwell was run into the leading part in a hurry, to
fill the place of Leslie Lawrence, who was ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I wanted that part.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I remember that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought it a shame to run in a rank amateur like
Merriwell on a lead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You said so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I was hot because I could not have the part, and
I did not rehearse very well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener nodded. He remembered all this perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In my heart,” Dunton went on, “was a perfect hell
of fury. I don’t think I ever felt that way before. My
hatred for Merriwell knew no bounds. I resolved to
show him up. I am something of a fencer and there was
a sword duel in the play. I was the villain in the piece,
and I fought with the hero. It was necessary for Merriwell
to do the duel with me. In the piece I should seem
to have the best of it at first, and then he should show
superior skill and disarm me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I remember all about that,” said Havener. “Go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was in that duel that I determined to make a
monkey of him. I would show the audience what a
stick he was.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Ephraim Gallup chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve known other folks to git fooled in a real duel
with him,” said the Vermonter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This turned out a real duel,” said Dunton. “When
the time came, I insulted Merriwell by adding venom
to the regular lines of the part. I called him a crawling
cur. I did my best to make him feel my real contempt
for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank was smiling, but he said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The duel began,” Dunton continued. “I started to
play with Mr. Merriwell, who had rehearsed awkwardly
in the afternoon. To my surprise, I found his awkwardness
was gone. He met me with the touch and skill of an
expert. At first I could not realize that he had fooled
me. When I did, I was infuriated beyond measure. My
first thought was to wound him, if I could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener uttered a low exclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fought with all the skill and fury I knew,” said
Dunton; “but he met all my attacks, and held me at
bay with ease. My rage increased till I lost my head entirely.
I longed to kill him, I swore I would kill him—I
made a desperate attempt to do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gosh!” gasped the Vermont youth, staring at the
speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I remember that the duel was the finest I ever saw
on the stage,” said Havener, “but I was afraid something
would happen. I didn’t dream it was a real duel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was,” nodded Dunton. “I lunged straight for
Merriwell’s body, trying to run him through.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, darn my pertaturs!” palpitated Ephraim Gallup.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that he understood my purpose. I do not
think I deceived Mr. Merriwell for a moment. He met
me fairly. Then, before I knew it, my weapon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>wrenched from my hand and sent spinning into the
air.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hooray!” exclaimed the Vermont youth, with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell caught it when it came down, and immediately
offered it to me, hilt first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thutteration!” gurgled Gallup.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A single moment I hesitated,” the actor continued,
“and then I was seized by such rage as I never felt before
and never expect to feel again. I snatched the
weapon and made one mad lunge to drive it straight
through the heart of my antagonist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Yankee lad nearly lost his breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell was on guard for me. He was not
taken unawares, and he foiled my attempt. Then he attacked
me with such fury that I could not stand before
him. I was driven back and back. I saw a terrible
light in his eyes, even though he laughed in my face.
His sword was flashing and glittering everywhere. I
realized that I was completely at his mercy, and I believed
he intended to kill me. Then I dropped my
sword and cried for mercy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoop!” exploded Gallup. “That’s ther way Frank
Merriwell serves ’em! Oh, he is the boy ter do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” finished Dunton, “I more than half expected
to be cut down, but nothing of the kind happened. I
remember with what scorn Mr. Merriwell said he would
not stain his sword with my treacherous blood. I remember
how I felt after that. No person can understand
the tumult of feelings in my heart. I thought of
running away. You complimented us on the duel after
the curtain had fallen, Mr. Havener, but you warned us
that we were far too reckless, and we must not do it that
way again. I believed Mr. Merriwell would expose me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>then. He did not. Then I was sure he would do so
very soon. He did not. I waited in suspense as long
as I could stand it, and then I came and asked him
when he was going to blow the whole thing. He said he
was going to wait and see how I behaved in the future,
and that he had no thought of blowing if I didn’t try it
again. Well, I haven’t tried it. Have I, Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” answered Frank, “we haven’t had much trouble
since then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to think I never knew a thing about this before!”
exclaimed the stage manager. “Mr. Merriwell never
breathed a word of it to me—not a word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course he didn’t!” exclaimed Ephraim. “He
never blows anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Dunton kept his word to me,” said Frank. “I am
sure it was my place to keep mine to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you engaged him for your own company!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; he was too good a man to let slip. I had a place
for him, and he has filled it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I think,” said Douglas Dunton, seriously, “that
my association with Frank Merriwell has improved me in
various ways. Anyone who takes him for a model is
bound to improve.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, b’gosh!” nodded Gallup.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge came rushing into Merriwell’s room almost as
soon as Frank arrived. He waved two papers over his
head in a triumphant way, crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great stuff, Frank—great stuff!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry was astounded, for such a demonstration on the
part of Hodge was almost unprecedented.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dramatic papers from the East.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Well, what about them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got full reports of ‘True Blue’ in ’em. Great stuff, I
tell you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, this is interesting. The papers must have given
the play a good send off?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great—simply great! Here’s the <cite>Dramatic Reflector</cite>,
the leading New York paper, and it has almost a quarter
of a column about the production of your piece in
Puleob.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As much as that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. And the <i>Snipper</i> gives you a good long notice,
too. The <i>Reflector</i> says ‘True Blue’ is a winner from the
start, and you are a dandy in your part. The <i>Snipper</i>
does not give the cast, same as the other paper, but its
notice is just as complimentary. Here, read ’em, read
’em!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank took the papers and read the notices. His face
showed his satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is better than I expected,” he said. “Now I understand
how it happened that I received notice in St. Jo
that there was an opening in New York for the week that
I desired. The manager of the theater had seen these
notices.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s about the size of it,” nodded Hodge. “Oh,
you are on the straight road to success—you are forging
to the front.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I have hopes of getting there,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will. I know that. Just think of the houses we
had in St. Jo. And the advance sale here is remarkable.
The manager says he never knew such a sale but
once before. The house will be jammed to-night. We
could play here three nights to paying business, and this
is a small place. What’ll we do when we hit Chicago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Chicago will be the test.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I shall be able to tell in Chicago whether the
piece will be a success or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t know about that. You can’t be sure. The
taste of Chicago sometimes varies from that of New
York. What is a success in one place is sometimes a
failure in the other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that happens so seldom that it is an exception.
If ‘True Blue’ catches on in Chicago, it will go in New
York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I believe it is bound to go anywhere. It took
me some time to realize you had written a better play than
your first one, but I know it now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The door was standing ajar. Cassie Lee appeared outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I come in?” she called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come right in, Cassie,” invited Frank. “Who’s that
following you? Tell him to come in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The soubrette entered, followed by Havener.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I came to tell you something,” she said, but hesitated,
as she saw Bart sitting there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it’s anything private, I’ll disappear,” said Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s nothing private,” declared Havener. “There is
no reason for being secret about it, Cassie. The entire
company knows we’re engaged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t feel just like—like——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I know,” smiled Havener, who looked decidedly
happy. “But I’ll tell. We’re going to be married in
Chicago, Mr. Merriwell. We have settled on that. I’ve
induced Cassie to agree to it at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I congratulate you, Havener!” exclaimed Frank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>grasping his hand and shaking it warmly. “I believe you
will be happy together, and surely you deserve happiness,
if any man deserves it, for fortune was rather hard
on you in your other venture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart rose and extended his hand to the stage manager.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Permit me to add my congratulations,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener accepted Bart’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Cassie,” said Frank, looking into the eyes of the
girl. “Why, she’s changed remarkably in the last few
weeks. The sad look has gone from her face, and there
is color coming to her cheeks and luster to her eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I owe you everything, Frank!” she murmured.
“Everything!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You gave me courage to fight my terrible habit. You
encouraged me to pray. Heaven gave me strength. I
believe I have won at last; but not until I was reasonably
sure of that would I again consent to the marriage after
that woman interfered with the other. The shock of that
nearly sent me back into my old ways again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it has ended well at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very glad, Cassie—glad for both you and Havener.
I knew how much depended on it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The happiness of our lives depended on it—yes, our
very lives!” asserted the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Frank, “I presume I am to be best man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course!” cried Havener and Cassie together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then that is settled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have satisfied myself beyond a doubt, and Cassie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>also, that the woman I believed my wife was the lawful
wife of another at the time we were living together. She
committed bigamy. That clears me of her, and I am
free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank showed Havener and Cassie the notices in the
dramatic papers, and they took their turn to congratulate
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sun of happiness and prosperity is shining brightly
on all of us just now,” said Merry. “I see my way clear
to get back to college, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave the rest of us in the lurch,” laughed Havener.
“Well, I guess we can take care of ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t propose to leave the rest of you in the
lurch, Havener.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This play will go on the road again next season.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; who will manage it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roscoe Havener.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener was astounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have resolved on that, if you care to take it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The stage manager was dazed for the moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that is so good of you!” cried Cassie. “Just
think of it, Ross! You were saying yesterday that you’d
give anything if you had a piece like this for me to
play in!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it,” said Havener; “but I never dreamed
of——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor did I!” cried the little soubrette. “Oh, how
can we thank Frank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” said Havener. “Words can’t seem
to express what I want to say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Same here!” chirped Cassie.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Don’t say anything,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how are we to get all the money to back the
piece?” asked Havener.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll back it myself,” said Frank. “That is, I’ll do it
if Chicago and New York does not break me. Of course,
I may run against snags in those places. If I get broken,
I believe you should be able to find an angel, Havener, in
case I do not keep in the business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a shame that you are thinking of leaving just as
you’re getting such a start!” cried Cassie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to get back to college,” said Frank. “I feel
something drawing me back there. If I wait longer, my
old classmates and chums will be gone. Of course I can
go back and finish my course, but it will not be the same.
I have made up my mind to return to Yale somehow in
the fall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Cassie, “whatever you do, I wish you good
fortune and happiness, for I am sure you deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. A man deserves what he wins. I have
worked hard to win out, and prosperity seems coming my
way at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Havener and Cassie departed pretty soon, and Frank
turned to find Bart seated on a chair, his elbows resting
on his knees, and his face hidden in his hands.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>BART AND DAISY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The change from Hodge’s jubilation of a short time
before to his present attitude and appearance of dejection
was rather startling. Merry paused an instant,
then stepped forward quickly, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge did not stir.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank’s hand fell gently on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter, old man?” asked Merry, softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing,” mumbled Hodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but there is,” declared Frank. “You were feeling
well enough a short time ago. What’s the meaning of
this change?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge was silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, Bart,” said Merry, gently, “I’m your
friend—I’m the one for you to talk to about this matter,
old man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart looked up, now, but there was something like defiance
in his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There isn’t anything to talk about,” he asserted.
“Can’t a fellow have the blues once in a while, if he
wants ’em!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nobody wants the blues, Hodge. A man in good
health, with a liver that is not torpid, should not have the
blues. Is there anything the matter with your liver?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dunno.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was a cause for the sudden change in you,”
said Merry, seriously. “A little while ago you seemed
in better spirits than you have shown before for a month.
And now you are in the funks.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Oh, don’t use that word!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What word?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Funk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter with that word?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Yale slang.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge sprang up and walked the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to hear it!” he cried, fiercely. “I don’t
want to hear anything that will remind me of Yale! Isn’t
it bad enough for me to know you are going back
there!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid I do not quite understand you,” said
Merry, slowly. “Why should you feel that way about
it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am an outcast! You are going back to finish your
course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you jealous, Hodge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I’m glad you’re going—I’m glad for you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what is the matter? You seem to be completely
off your trolley, old man. You’re getting freakish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I suppose so! Rub it in! I had a letter from
my mother yesterday. She said she was sorry to give
me up, but I had been a terrible disappointment to her.
She did hope I would get through college. She was
sending me money to get through on, you know. I was
a fool! I gambled her money away, and she sent it without
letting my father know, for he would have stopped
her had he known. Oh, isn’t there a reason why I should
feel blue?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you are inclined to make things out worse
than they are, Hodge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Worse! worse! Ha! ha! How could they be any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>worse? Here my mother, who has clung to me all
through everything, is giving up in despair! She thinks
I have gone to the dogs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I suppose you do not write and tell her all the
truth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the use?” said Bart, bitterly. “She knows I
ran away from college. Do you fancy it would make her
feel any better to know I did so because I could not meet
the gambling debts I had contracted? In this case, it is
better not to tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I will write to your mother, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have something to tell her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you are going back to college in the fall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge stopped and stared at Frank. After a few
moments, he spoke:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why would you tell her such a thing as that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would make her feel better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you were speaking of telling the truth a moment
ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I should be telling the truth then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing but the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, Merriwell, I want to know just what you
are driving at! Come out and give it to me straight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” smiled Frank. “I mean that you are going
back to college when I go. Is that plain enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s plain enough, but it’s you who are off your
trolley.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I think not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are, just the same. I am done with Yale. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>could I go back there, after skipping out as I did and
leaving all those debts? It’s impossible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know your debts were paid. When Browning
returned to college, he squared them all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without my knowledge, Merriwell. I refused to let
you send the money, but you did it without letting me
know a thing about it. I was the one to pay the debts I
had contracted. You did that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something I’ll guarantee is known to no person but
Browning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was bound by a pledge not to say I had anything
to do with it, but to give the impression that the money
came from you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Something misty came into the eyes of the dark-haired
lad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merriwell,” he said, huskily, “I’d be an ungrateful
churl not to appreciate such kindness!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right, old man; it’s what I’d wish another to
do for me were I in your place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s exactly what you would not accept from another.
I know that. You put me in this position without
my consent. Now I owe you all that money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forget it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s easy to say, but it’s not easy to do. Now you
are going back to college, and what’s to become of me?
I am left!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you that you are going with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I have no love for any of your Yale friends. Of
course I was sorry that I failed to finish my course and
graduate. It’s too late now. I tell you my mother has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>given me up. That makes it impossible for me to return
to college. She was paying my way. Now there
is no one to furnish me with money, and I am as bad off
as you were when you lost your fortune.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart, I’ve been thinking of something lately. You
know all about our discovery of the lost fortune in the
Utah Desert.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know all about your discovery of it, and I know
no other person had a hand in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Browning, Diamond, Rattleton and Toots were
with me. It has been divided equally among us. Shortly
after the discovery of that treasure you joined our party.
I have thought it all over, and it seems no more than fair
that you should have a share of that fortune.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re going daffy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit of it. I say it is right. The others have
received their shares, but you shall have your share of
mine. I will divide with you, and that will give you
four thousand dollars. With that sum you can return
to college and finish your course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to know what you take me for!” he cried.
“Are you trying to insult me, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know better!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you imagine I’m a fool?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, don’t ever make me such an offer again.
You know what I think of those chaps who accepted the
checks you sent them. You know I believe that treasure
belonged entirely to you, and no other had a right to a dollar
of it. Do you take me for a fellow who would accept
from you a gift of four thousand dollars? Well, that’s
what you propose to make me—nothing more, nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>less. It won’t go with me, Merriwell. I do not thank
you for the offer, for you should have known better than
to make it. Go back to Yale. I wish you good fortune—I
wish you everything you desire. I will go my way in
the world; you’ll go yours. It must come to that in time,
anyhow. What odds if it comes sooner than we had anticipated!
You have taken an interest in me, Frank, and
your friendship is the pleasantest memory of my life; but
even that must become a mere memory sometime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no reason why it should become a mere
memory while life shall last,” said Frank, soberly.
“Though fate may divide us, still our friendship should
remain firm and unshaken. As for your return to Yale,
I’m not going to say anything more about it now, but I
shall not give it up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While a rehearsal was taking place for the benefit of
the supers that afternoon the local stage manager came to
Frank and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell, there is a young lady down at the
door who wishes to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A young lady?” exclaimed Merry, not without a feeling
of consternation, for his recent experiences in St.
Joseph were vivid in his memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know her name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But she belongs in this town?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Methinks thou hast another mash, most noble grand
high muck-a-muck,” spouted Douglas Dunton, in the
eccentric manner he sometimes assumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid so,” admitted Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perchance thou wouldst send me down to see the fair
damsel—but I doubt it,” murmured Dunton.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“No,” said Frank, “I think I had better go down
myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He went down to the door and found the girl who was
waiting there. He was surprised to see her standing
with her head bowed, in an attitude of apparent dejection
and shame.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you wish to see me, miss?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>She nodded her head, but did not look up, not a little to
his perplexity and wonderment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Merriwell,” she murmured, “I have come to
thank you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To thank me?” exclaimed Merry. “For what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For your kindness to me in St. Joseph.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank’s heart dropped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good gracious!” he thought. “Has she followed us
from St. Jo.?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the girl looked up, and he recognized her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy Blaney!” he exclaimed. “Why, I didn’t know
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>No wonder he had not recognized the bold, saucy,
reckless girl in this meek, abashed, low-spoken maiden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Daisy Blaney,” she said. “I thought perhaps
you did not want to know me, and I did not wonder
much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t want to know you? Why not, Miss Blaney?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, because—because—you know,” she faltered, in
confusion. “I reckon I ain’t just the sort of girl you
would be proud to introduce to your friends. You didn’t
meet me under very favorable circumstances, and you
must think I’m pretty far down the scale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope not,” said Merry, quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, I know just what you think, and I don’t know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that I blame you much. You are different from any
show feller I ever met before. I never fancied any of
them cared a snap what became of a girl if they could
have a good time. None of them ever gave me any good
advice before. I never saw one before you who was not
ready to catch on and have a racket. Instead of catching
on, you gave me a calling down. I knew I deserved it,
and it made me feel all the more reckless. I thought I
was too far on the road to turn back, and I tried to forget
what you said to me; but I couldn’t forget it, and it
kept sounding in my ears all the time. I couldn’t run
away from the sound; I couldn’t drown it with music and
laughter. I saw you looking at me in that sympathizing,
pitying way, and, though I tried to laugh at you for a
fool, your eyes haunted me. Oh, I tell you I was right
miserable after that talk with you. You set me to thinking
of mother and home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother and home!” said Frank, softly. “The two
strongest influences for good. How many a wayward
wanderer has been reclaimed by thoughts of mother and
home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If mother had had her way at home I’d never left,”
the girl went on. “It was the old man—father, I mean.
He drove me away. He didn’t seem to understand me at
all. If I made a little mistake, he was so harsh and cruel
with me. Why,” she exclaimed, suddenly relapsing into
slang under the pressure of excitement, “the old duffer
uster be a pretty gay boy himself, and there wasn’t any
reason why his daughter shouldn’t take after him. All
the same, he never thought of that, but he was dead hard
on me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank knew this was the fault of many fathers. They
forgot their own younger days and were harsh and hard
with their sons or daughters who showed they had inherited
certain lively qualities from their parents.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“But your mother—for her sake, you must overlook
anything from your father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I suppose I ought, but it’s pretty hard sometimes.
He’s tried to be so strict with me it’s driven me
to do some of the things I have done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is where you are making your mistake. I do
not wish to lecture you now, Miss Blaney, and I am going
to say no more about it. I am glad I was able to find
you that night in St. Jo.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes began to shine and something like a flush
came to her cheeks, which, with satisfaction, Merry observed
were now unmarred by paint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were brave, Frank Merriwell!” she cried; “just
as you seemed to be in the play—just as I knew you
were! Those men did not frighten you in the least. You
fought the whole crowd like a tiger. But I thought you
would be killed till that woman interfered. Who was
she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A stranger—a woman I had never seen but once before
in my life. Then she was in a plot to blackmail me.
The plot failed, and she was ready to turn against her
accomplices. What do you know of her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing, save that she is known in the sporting
circles of St. Jo. as Queen Mab, and she is something of a
mystery. There’s not a gay girl in the city who would
not give anything to be like Queen Mab.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure the woman is not all bad. It was rare good
fortune that brought your mother along there just as we
escaped from the place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“One reason why I came here was to thank you,” said
the girl; “but there is another reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I want to warn you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To warn me?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“You have had some trouble with Sam Hooker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everybody in town has heard of it. Sam is in disgrace,
but he has sworn a great oath that he’ll disgrace
you worse than you did him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he has?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I heard it from his brother Joe. You know Joe
kind of—kind of—— Well, he calls at our house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl’s confusion explained her meaning. The red
blood mounted to her face now, and Frank saw she was
ashamed of Joe Hooker when she compared him with
some of the flashy city youths she had met.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told you?” questioned Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I pumped it all out of him. He doesn’t know I
ever met you in all my life. I slipped in here on the sly,
so they would not catch on that I had warned you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was kind of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; it won’t half pay back what you did for me—the
risk you ran. I was thinking of that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To Frank it seemed a case of “bread on the waters.”
But he had not learned what plot had been formed
against him, and his curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe says Sam is just furious,” the girl went on. “He
is fierce enough to kill you. He would kill you, if he
dared. He loaded up his guns and swore a mighty oath
to make you regret the day you were born.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is considerable wind about Sam Hooker,” said
Frank; “but still he might be driven to something desperate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know he’s been a cowboy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, he says so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He really has, and he can throw a lasso.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“He’s coming to the show to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He says he’s going to bring his lasso.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he swears he will rope you from the stage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that it?” cried Merry. “So that is what he means
to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. He says he’ll drag you over the footlights and
clean out of the theater.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, this is rather interesting!” exclaimed Frank;
“and I am greatly obliged to you for telling me about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What will you do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be prepared for Mr. Hooker, be sure of that.
But you must take care not to let him know you have
told me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little danger of that. I wouldn’t dare. Joe invited
me to come to the theater with him to see Sam square
the score. I shall be here, and I do hope you will look
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry at all about that, Miss Blaney. Now
that I know what is coming, there is not the least danger
in the world that I shall not be ready.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad I was able to warn you, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may prove a most fortunate thing for me. I thank
you, Miss Blaney. I shall not forget your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He held out his hand, and she grasped it eagerly, looking
up into his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mr. Merriwell!” she exclaimed; “I hope you’ll
not think of me as so very bad! I hope you won’t remember
me that way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he said, looking straight into her eyes; “I shall
not think of you that way, Miss Blaney. I shall think of
you as the joy of your mother in her old age. I shall
think of you as loving and soothing her in her declining
years. I hope I shall not be mistaken in my thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“You shall not!” she said, earnestly; “I promise you
that, Frank Merriwell! I will be a better girl in the
future. It will help me to be better knowing you remember
me that way. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned hurriedly and was gone.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>PLAIN WORDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The entire company seemed in high spirits that night as
the time approached for the curtain to rise on the opening
scene of the first act.</p>

<p class='c007'>People were pouring into the theater. Every seat had
been sold, and the sign “S. R. O.” was displayed at the
box office.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Methinks this settles it,” spouted Douglas Dunton, behind
the curtain. “Prosperity has struck us hard, and
we are winners from the word ‘go.’ Oh, this whole company
is hot stuff!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The orchestra began to play, and Frank, made up for
his first appearance, came to the peephole and looked out
at the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every seat in the Wilcoxson Opera House was filled.
The rear of the theater was packed with those who had
paid admission for the privilege of standing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By gum! it’s a sight fer sore eyes!” exclaimed Ephraim
Gallup, close to Frank. “Don’t yeou think so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank did not reply, for he was searching the faces of
those in the rows near the stage, looking for Sam
Hooker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry muttered the words as his eyes rested on the
ruffian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam had secured a seat where he could easily accomplish
his purpose, as he fancied. There was a look of
fierce determination on his countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>After looking at the fellow some moments, Merry said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll try it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the dickens are yeou talkin’ abaout, Frank?”
asked Gallup.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merriwell straightened up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ephraim,” he said, “go find Mr. Garland and bring
him to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Vermonter hurried away, soon returning with
Granville Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great fortune, Mr. Merriwell!” exclaimed Garland.
“That’s the sort of a house that pays. It strikes me we
are forging to the front with great strides.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Garland,” said Frank, “have you the revolver
you draw on me in the first act?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me take it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garland, wondering a little, passed the weapon to
Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately Frank took some cartridges from his
pocket, snapped the weapon open, and——</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing?” exclaimed Garland, in perplexity.
“The revolver was loaded, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With blanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am loading it with another kind of cartridge,” said
Frank, as he refilled the cylinder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not with regular cartridges?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—why, I don’t understand why you are doing
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose not,” admitted Frank, as he finished loading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and snapped the weapon back into shape. “I didn’t think
you would understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A weapon that is loaded with anything but blank
cartridges is not a very safe thing to squabble over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is true, and, for that reason, we must be very
careful in our squabble over it to-night, Mr. Garland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really, I—I don’t like this. What if something happened!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something is liable to happen. That is why I have
loaded this weapon. If I should call for it suddenly, you
are to pass it to me; but I do not think I shall need it till
after the struggle takes place. It will be in my possession
from that time on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Won’t you explain, Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. It is sufficient that I have a reason for wishing
this revolver loaded with something besides blanks. Here,
take it, Garland, and be careful with it. When you pull
it on me, point it in the air and begin to pull down with
it. I will spring forward and grasp it before it covers
me. Keep your finger off the trigger. Do not hang to
it quite as tight as usual in the struggle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Garland, in a puzzled way; “but I’d
give something to know what is going on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim Gallup was as much puzzled as Garland, but
he asked no questions, for he knew there were times when
it was utterly useless to question Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of Merriwell’s strange act passed from mouth
to mouth, and the actors and actresses were puzzled and
bewildered over it. Agnes Kirk even declared that she
believed success had turned Frank’s brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was always queer,” she asserted. “A fellow who
will stoop to feed and pet a tramp cat and then carry it
around as a mascot is not right. But I call on everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>to notice that we have become prosperous since he
let that cat go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I hardly think that,” said Stella Stanley. “He
did not let the cat go till after this piece had made a hit.
Then he said he could not carry the creature around, and
he would prove she had nothing to do with the success or
failure of the show by letting her go. He seemed to
knock the wind out of your superstitious prophecies,
Agnes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all,” declared the other actress, stiffly. “I said
the cat would hoodoo us in the first place, and it did, no
matter what happened afterward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s no use to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stella Stanley turned away, laughing. She saw Hodge,
standing at a distance, regarding her steadfastly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the affair in Atchison, when Bart deserted the
company, the dark-faced youth had scarcely spoken to
Stella. After being brought back by Frank, he seemed
to take the utmost pains to avoid her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as she started toward him, he wheeled about and
disappeared behind the back drop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to know what ails him!” she exclaimed, somewhat
angrily. “He shan’t keep up this running away from
me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she followed Hodge and ran him down back
where the shadows were thickest. She grasped him with
both hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, Bart Hodge!” she exclaimed; “do you
think I’m going to eat you up? or what ails you? You
run away from me as if you regarded me as a snake!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge stood there, silent, looking at her. She gave him
a shake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Stop it!” she cried. “I’m tired of it! I don’t like it!
I won’t have it! Will you be good enough, Mr. Bart
Hodge, to treat me differently?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” he said, obstinately. “Why should I?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is every reason why I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Name a few of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To begin with, you regard me as a mere boy—a stripling
who does not know his own mind. You insulted me
when I told you of my admiration for you. You laughed
at me. You might as well have said ‘calf love.’ I won’t
stand for that kind of treatment from you or any other
woman!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not laugh at him now, for he was beginning to
realize that he could not be treated like a boy. She could
not flatter and flirt with him as she did with Billy Wynne.
His admiration for her was not of the sort to endure that
kind of cajolery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Hodge,” she said, “if I did anything to offend
you, if I was offensive, I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you beg my pardon, but you will go on regarding
me as an addle-pated boy. If I dared open my lips to
honestly tell you of my admiration, you would laugh at
me! Oh, I know! You are like them all—only handsomer
and colder!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have a fancy that you have read me, Bart Hodge,
but let me tell you that you are a very poor judge of
human nature. You seldom read anybody aright.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not such a difficult thing to read a woman,” he
sneered. “They are all alike in one respect—they are as
treacherous and fickle as cats! They think they love.
They enjoy being petted and caressed. They purr and
show all sorts of affection, but they are shallow. No
more than a cat do they know true affection! As ready as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>a cat are they to sink their claws into the hand that
caresses them! And when their master is gone, like a
cat, they seek petting and fondling from another. They
cannot be constant till the master returns; they cannot be
true to death and after—like a faithful dog!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stella Stanley was rather high-spirited, and it made her
“hot” to hear anybody talk in such a manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are trying your best to insult me now,” she said,
“and you are succeeding very well! I’d like to tell you
what I think of men like you, but I haven’t the time, and
I don’t choose to waste my breath on you now. In some
respects, I admire you; in others, I despise you. You are
like all men, thoroughly unjust toward women. Other
men may hide their thoughts, but you speak out; that is
the difference. Men talk of the fickleness of women, but
experience shows that women are far more constant than
men. Once a woman loves a man truly, with all her
heart and soul, she never loves another like that. She
gives that man all that is best of her. What does she receive
in return? If he provides her a home, clothes, food,
he thinks he is doing his full duty. Don’t talk to me of
the fickleness of women!” she hissed. “Don’t ever dare
speak to me again like this, Bart Hodge! Sometimes I
think I admire you, but when you show yourself as you
have just now, I despise you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With that she left him; but she did not despise him,
for all of her words.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Bart? He was trembling all over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Heaven!” he hoarsely whispered. “I could love
her, but I won’t!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>AN ASTONISHING SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The overture was finished, and the orchestra played a
“riser” for the curtain to go up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“True Blue” began.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was an audience to make any actor do his best. Gallup
in the part of <i>Reuben Grass</i> soon put the audience
in a good humor. He strolled onto the stage in his jay
make-up, singing the song with which he had made such a
hit in Merriwell’s first play:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I alwus mind what dad says ter me</div>

      <div class='line'>But when I’m away ’way outer his sight</div>
      <div class='line'>I do jest abaout as any boy might;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fer then I know that he’ll never see</div>
      <div class='line'>That I don’t mind what he says ter me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The audience received him with a burst of applause,
and Ephraim responded by getting off several country
gags that delighted everybody.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, not everybody. Down near the front sat a man
who scowled and glowered at the stage. It was Sam
Hooker, and he was there to make trouble. He was
handling something which Gallup could not see. Ephraim
paused and winked at the ruffian in a most tantalizing
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The audience was waiting for the appearance of the
star. The whole town had heard of the manner in which
Frank had treated the terror of the place, and everybody
seemed anxious for a look at the boyish actor who
had dared face the ruffian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Granville Garland, as <i>Carius Dubad</i>, came on and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>carried things with a high hand, everything leading up
to an effective enter for Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dubad</i> was terrorizing <i>Grass</i> when the moment
came for Merry to make his appearance. As he entered
there was a great burst of applause and a voice from the
gallery cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s him! That’s Frank Merriwell hisself, and he’s
a lollypalooser!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then about fifty boys jumped up in the gallery and
yelled like a lot of wild Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after his enter, Frank’s lines caused him
to threaten to fling the villain of the piece out of the
house, whereupon the villain drew a revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the weapon Frank had loaded with bullet-bearing
cartridges. Merry sprang on Garland and wrested
the revolver from his hand, while Ephraim looked on
in apparent terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this brief struggle was taking place, Sam
Hooker rose to his feet, roaring:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoop! He’s a purty lively maverick, but I’m ther
puncher ter put my brand on him. First I’ll rope him,
same as I would a steer. Hyar goes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Round and round his head he swung a lariat, and then
he quickly made the throw.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man’s words had warned Merry that the time for
action had come. With the loaded revolver in his hand,
he sprang back from Garland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The noose of the lasso came shooting through the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as thought, Frank lifted the revolver and fired a
single shot. The bullet cut the rope, and the noose fell
harmlessly at the feet of the young actor!</p>

<p class='c007'>It was over in the twinkling of an eye, and the ruffianly
cowboy stood there with the useless end of the cut rope in
his hands, dazed and bewildered by what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The audience was startled, and Frank saw that the people
must be calmed at once, so he immediately stepped
to the footlights and began to speak:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “there is no real
cause for alarm. Please keep your seats. The attempt
of this ruffian with the rope to break up the performance
has proved a failure. This is his third attack to-day
upon me. I fancied I had taught him a lesson, but he
does not seem to have sense enough to know it. Now, if
there is an officer present, I wish he would remove the
man from the house. The performance will then go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, dern my eyes!” muttered Sam Hooker, having
drawn in the rope and examined the severed end. “Ther
critter shot it in two with a bullet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there an officer present?” asked Frank, from the
stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You needn’t call fer an officer,” said Sam Hooker.
“I’ll go right out without no trouble. You say I ain’t got
sense enough ter know when I’m beat. Mebbe not, but
I’ve got sense enough ter know you froze me out on this
yar game without half tryin’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the dejected ruffian turned and made for the
door, hissed on every hand by the angry audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Hooker had disappeared, the performance continued
as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not a little excitement among the actors.
They bombarded Merriwell with questions at the end of
the act. They wanted to know how it happened that he
had been aware of Hooker’s intention. On this point he
did not enlighten them, but he assured them he had been
prepared for any move the ruffian had contemplated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time between the acts gave the audience a chance
to buzz about the remarkable thing that had happened.
Some could not believe it possible Frank had cut the rope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>with a bullet. Not a few insisted that it was impossible,
because actors never used weapons loaded with bullets on
the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>But all had witnessed what had happened, and it was
plain the star had defeated Sam Hooker’s purpose in
some manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no further attempt to interrupt the performance,
although some timid ones expected Hooker to
return with a gang of roughs and create disturbance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The performance was over at last, and Frank breathed
easy. Although he had been on his guard for anything
that might happen, he could not help feeling relieved
when the curtain fell on the last act without witnessing
another effort to break him up or molest him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, by gum!” said Ephraim Gallup, as he met
Frank behind the curtain, “yeou’ve made a new record
ter-night. If yeou don’t use that fer advertising in ther
Chicago papers, yeou are dead slow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Use what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shootin’ that rope in tew. It’d be a great story for
yeour press agint. Yeou oughter git it sworn to by reliable
parties who saw it, an’ telegraph it to yeour agint
right off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I haven’t thought of that. I’m afraid it would
seem too much like a fake to be swallowed by the people
who read the theatrical columns in the papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not by a darn sight! Yeou kin git it sworn tew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I think we can draw houses in Chicago without
the use of that yarn. It may be all right, but I don’t
fancy we need it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, Frank!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me ’tend to that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Let me git reliable persons to swear ter whut they
saw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if you want to——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ let me telegraph it to Riddle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right!” exclaimed Ephraim. “I bet yeou four
dollars I git aout a yarn that packs your theatur in
Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a run for his dressing room to get off his
stage dress and make-up, eager to carry out his plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hodge was in the sulks and would have nothing to say
to anybody. As soon as possible he left the theater and
went to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ephraim, hot to get reliable citizens of Carrolton to
swear to the remarkable happening of that night, had
also left.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who were not required to remain behind and
handle scenery did not lose much time in getting their
make-up off and their effects together, after which they
departed for the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank lingered to watch the packing of the special
scenery. He was not supposed to do this, but his anxiety
that everything should be done right led him to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the last of it was nearly packed, Frank put on
his light coat and left the theater by the side door.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not gone twenty steps from the door before he
fancied he heard a light step behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly Frank whirled about.</p>

<p class='c007'>Too late!</p>

<p class='c007'>Something settled over his head and entangled him in
muffling folds. At the same moment he received a blow
that knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although thus attacked from behind and taken by surprise,
Frank made a desperate fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>He realized he had been set upon by several assailants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and they were trying to beat him into nonresistance.
For a time the blanket protected him from the force of
their blows, but it smothered him, and he grew weaker
and weaker. He did not give up, however, as long as he
had the least strength left to resist.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he was beaten into a state of helplessness, and
then, still enfolded by the smothering blanket, he was
hurriedly lifted and carried away by strong hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Merry came to himself he found himself in
a small room that was poorly lighted by a single kerosene
lamp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five men were in that room, all wearing masks that
completely hid their faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a stove a fire was burning, while on the stove sat a
big pan, which contained some substance that gave out a
peculiar odor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The odor that came to Merry’s nostrils was that of tar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men seemed waiting for him to recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s comin’ round,” said one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of the masked gang uttered an exclamation of
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad the critter ain’t hurt much,” he said, in a
voice which Frank instantly recognized. “I didn’t want
ter crack his head, fer that ’ud spoil ther fun we’re goin’
ter have with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He won’t make much spread on the stage for a long
time after we get through with him,” said the first
speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not onless he does so as a curiosity,” chuckled the
other, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then this one stepped up to Merry and kicked him in
the ribs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, my pritty dude actor,” he said, roughly. “We’re
goin’ ter give ye a new suit o’ clothes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this the other masked ruffians laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“Thank you, Sam Hooker,” said Frank, quite coolly.
“You are becoming exceedingly generous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who ye callin’ Sam Hooker?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, yer needn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is your name. You can’t fool me, even if your
face is hidden. I know you. I know your voice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waal, what ther blazes do I care!” cried the man,
stripping the mask from his face and casting it aside. “I
want yer ter know me! I want yer ter know I’m gittin’
even with yer. I am Sam Hooker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would look better if you kept on the mask,” said
Merry. “Anything to hide that villainous face of yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drat ye! Do you dast talk ter me like that now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Hooker kicked Merry in the ribs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a good time for you to do that!” exclaimed Frank,
scornfully. “You wouldn’t dare if my hands were free!
You are a coward—a miserable coward!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold yer tongue!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you can’t keep that still, unless you gag me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t? Waal, you may git another rap on ther head
that’ll keep it still!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a wonder to me that a ruffian of your stamp has
hesitated at murder. Go ahead with your dirty work!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we ain’t goin’ ter kill ye! Not much! We’ve
got somethin’ better fer ye! We’ve got somethin’ you’ll
like—I don’t think!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” laughed one of the others. “It’ll keep
ye good an’ warm, an’ you’ll be a pretty picture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So both Hookers are in this little business. Joe, if
you follow in the tracks of your brother, I’ll guarantee
you will land in prison. He’ll be there within a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Hooker followed his brother’s example and tore
off his mask.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want ye ter know I’m in this business, too!” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>snarled. “If ye swear to it afterward, your word’s no
better’n ourn, and we’ll swear you lie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Merry, “if the rest of the fine gentlemen
will kindly uncover, we’ll be able to talk this matter over
face to face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the remaining three ruffians declined to show their
faces.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They jest come erlong to see ther fun,” said the cowboy.
“We’re goin’ ter do ther business. Eh, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your game?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, ye’re anxious ter know! You’ll find out soon
enough. Is ther tar hot, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I reckon it’s hot enough for our requirements.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we’d better prepare the gent for his new suit
o’ clothes. Bring in ther feathers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Frank understood the foul purpose of the gang,
and his rage knew no bounds. However, he realized it
would be useless to give vent to his anger, and he held
himself in check.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tar and feathers, eh?” he said, apparently quite cool,
for all of the seething fury in his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye’ve struck it,” chuckled Sam Hooker, as Joe hurriedly
left the room. “You’ve made me ther laughin’-stock
o’ ther town, an’ now I’m goin’ ter disgrace you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe returned with an old pillow, which he quickly
ripped open, crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are yer feathers, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said the cowboy, “we’ll ondress ther gent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a minute,” said Frank. “I have a few words
to say to you before you begin your dirty work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak lively, fer we ain’t got no time ter waste. All
the same, ye may as well spare yer breath, fer nothin’
you kin say will make any difference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not expect it will, but I wish to make you a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>promise, Mr. Hooker. It is this: If you adorn me with
a coat of tar and feathers, I promise you that I will make
you regret the day you ever saw me. I promise you I
will make you weary of life! I will not rest in carrying
out my promise. I will hound you down, and I’ll make
you such an object of scorn and contempt that you will
long for death! I swear it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This vow had no effect on the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead!” cried Sam Hooker. “You’ve made me
ther laughin’ stock o’ Carrolton now, an’ I’m bound ter
git even with yer! Now, we’ll strip him, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the door bounded a girl. With all her
strength she pushed Sam Hooker aside. Over Frank
Merriwell she stood, with a hardwood baseball bat raised
aloft.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll brain the first man who touches him!” she almost
screamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Daisy Blaney!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>AN UNEQUAL BATTLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Daisy!” exclaimed Joe Hooker.</p>

<p class='c007'>His brother gave vent to an exclamation of rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back!” cried the girl. “You shall not harm him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe took a step forward, but she glared at him and
seemed ready to strike with all her strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll hit you, Joe Hooker, just as quick as anybody
else!” she declared. “And I reckon I can lay you out
with this bat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy, you don’t mean it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shan’t touch him, I tell ye!” she screamed. “He
was my friend. He talked to me better than anybody
ever did before. I won’t see him hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A greenish light came into Joe Hooker’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you in love with him?” he sneered. “Are you
struck on him, Daisy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I was,” she answered, defiantly, “I’d be struck on
a man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By blazes! I believe ye are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t see you do your mean work!” she panted.
“You were to blame in the first place, and you know it!
He met you like a man, and, because he was your master,
now you have plotted to disgrace him this way. Shame!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a fool, Daisy!” hissed Joe Hooker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve been a fool to have anything to do with you!” she
flung back. “I am done. From this night I’ll never speak
to you again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, ye won’t!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“No! I have seen the difference between a real man
and a common fellow who swaggers and blusters. Frank
Merriwell is a man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I wouldn’t let him off to save my life!” snarled
Joe, all the jealousy of his nature aroused. “You are
struck on him! He shall have a double coat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but he shall! What can you do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can fight to protect him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little good that will do! You are nothing but a
girl, and we are five men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you are not men! You are cowards—all of you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank admired the girl then. He strained at his bonds
trying to free his hands, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jump her, Joe!” snarled Sam Hooker. “She won’t
hit you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will!” she cried—“I swear I will! Don’t try to put
a hand on me, Joe Hooker! If you do, I’ll stretch you
on the floor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of a sudden Joe attempted another tack.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, come, Daisy,” he said, coaxingly, “don’t be foolish!
You can’t save him! Put down that bat and we
will talk it over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not on your life! I know what you want and you
don’t get it that way! Frank Merriwell has been good
to me, and I will fight for him as long as I can draw a
breath!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out!” exclaimed Merry, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of the other men—behind you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was too late, for one of the masked men had edged
along till he found a favorable opportunity to spring.
Now he made a leap at the girl, grasping the bat.</p>

<p class='c007'>She screamed and struggled, but it was useless then.
They seized her, tore the bat from her hands, held her
helpless, even though she bit and scratched.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“Take the cat out of here, Joe!” roared Sam Hooker.
“Be lively about it! Get her away, and keep her away!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Hooker lifted the girl in his arms and carried her
from the room, for all of her screams and struggles. He
was not gone long before he returned, slamming the door
and fastening it. He was panting, but seemed more
vicious than ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did ye do with her?” asked Sam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She broke away from me,” answered Joe. “Hurry up
with the job! I want to put the tar on myself! Oh, I’ll fix
him! She called him a man! She is struck on him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He glared at Frank, who was now sitting with his back
against the wall, having drawn himself into that position.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’d better be lively if that girl is free,” said Sam,
nervously. “There is no telling what she may do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They advanced on Frank, but stopped in surprise, as
he suddenly shot up to standing position, with his back
against the wall. There was a look in the eyes of the
captive that warned them he was not in a submissive
mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grab him, fellers!” ordered Joe Hooker. “Strip his
clothes off! We’ll have the tar and feathers onto him in
less than five minutes! We’ll fix him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He sprang at Frank, but out shot one of Merry’s feet,
striking Joe in the stomach and hurling him backward
with terrific force. The fellow dropped to the floor,
where he lay gasping, grunting and groaning, apparently
badly hurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam Hooker gave a howl of rage when he saw what
had happened to his brother. He had fancied Merriwell
was beyond making further resistance, but now he saw
his mistake. However, the fate that had befallen Joe did
not render him cautious. Uttering fierce language, he
rushed at Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>In France Frank Merriwell had learned to “box with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>his feet,” having taken lessons from a Frenchman who
was an expert in the art. Frank had realized the value
of being able to use his feet scientifically in a rough-and-tumble
fight, and now his acquirement stood him in good
stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Hooker had been kicked in the stomach, but his
brother received a kick under the chin that fairly lifted
him off the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam went down with a crash.</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked ruffians were astounded. They stared at
Frank as if unable to believe a youth whose hands were
tied behind his back had upset the terrible Hooker brothers
so quickly and easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go—for—him!” groaned Joe, catching his breath in
gasps. “Kill him! Smash him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank Merriwell laughed! It was the old-time ringing
laugh of defiance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on!” he invited. “My hands are helpless, but I
fancy I am a match for all of you, so long as I can see.
Come on!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked ruffians hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make a dive for him all at once!” cried one of them.
“Ready!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ready!” said the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At him they leaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had expected that he would stand still, but he did
nothing of the kind. He ducked and darted between
them. Then he whirled and raised one of them into the
air with a terrible kick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clinging to his jaw and snarling like a furious animal,
Sam Hooker struggled to his feet, meaning to take part in
the struggle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank saw the fellow getting up.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“I’d rather have a good lift at you than anybody else!”
cried Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>He got what he wanted. The kick he gave Sam
Hooker threw the fellow full upon the stove, and his
head struck in the pan of hot tar. Over the stove to the
floor went Sam, tar and all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the most frightful howls of pain issued from the
throat of the ruffian. He rolled about on the floor, clawing
at his face and eyes, and roaring with pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m killed!” he shouted. “Murder! Oh, wow!
Throw some water on me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He wouldn’t mind having the hose turned on him
now!” laughed Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe tried to get up, but he was kicked full against
his brother. In his agony, Sam struck out and smote
Joe full on the nose, causing the blood to flow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, this is a regular merry old spree of a time!”
exclaimed Frank Merriwell, as he danced backward,
still laughing. “You chaps seem to be having lots of
fun with me! Aren’t you glad you brought me here?
Isn’t it a real jolly time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he actually charged on the masked rascals, and
they dodged to get out of his way. Then might have
been seen the remarkable and ludicrous spectacle of three
men making frantic endeavors to avoid one whose hands
were tied behind his back—one whom a few moments before
they had regarded as a helpless captive!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whar’s my guns?” roared Sam Hooker. “I’ll shoot
ther critter full o’ lead! I’ll kill him! I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You seem to have a little tar on you, Sammy,”
laughed Frank. “Why, you make a real laughable
spectacle! If you could see yourself in a mirror you
would be greatly amused. It will take you several days
to comb the tar out of your hair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll kill you!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“I heard you say so before. You were going to tar
and feather me, but your scheme seems to have miscarried.
You’ve got the first dose of tar yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s that baseball bat?” howled Joe Hooker.
“I’ll beat his brains out! Give me that bat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw it and made a scramble for it, but Frank
headed him off and bowled him over, although Joe made
a desperate attempt to get hold of Merry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sam Hooker had not found his “guns,” but he was on
his feet now, and in his hand glittered a long knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ll fix him now!” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on!” cried one of the masked men. “That is
going too far! We don’t want a hand in a murder!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You go to blazes!” snarled Sam. “I’ll cut his
throat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a rush for Frank, brandishing the knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merry knew his life was in danger, but that did not
rob him of his nerve. He actually laughed again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brave fellow!” he cried. “It is what I expected of
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came a startling cry from one of the masked
men:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fire! fire! The house is on fire!”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the excitement of the struggle none of them had
noticed it, but now they saw the room was filling with
smoke. And they paused, they could hear the crackle
of the flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the fire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the men leaped to the door and tore it open.
Then they saw the gleam of the flames, and, for a
moment, they were appalled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old house is all afire!” shouted the man at the
door. “We must get out in a hurry if we want to get
out at all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there was a rush for the door.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Sam Hooker was the last of the gang to reach the
door. He turned a moment, and his tar-bedaubed face
made him look like a fiend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay here and roast to death, Frank Merriwell!” he
snarled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank bounded toward the door, but it closed with a
slam, and he recoiled helplessly from the shock of striking
against it. Again and again he flung himself against
that door, but it refused to yield, and he realized that he
was a helpless prisoner in the burning building, abandoned
to his doom by those dastardly ruffians.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was another door, and Frank tried that, but it
was as solid as the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked for windows, but the only one he could see
was in the roof, far above his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cooped up!” he muttered. “Done for! Left to
roast!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a terrible position. He could hear the crackling
of the flames as they gained headway, and the smoke came
pouring into the room so thickly that it threatened to
strangle him. He coughed and choked and hurled himself
again and again against the doors, till he was weak and
battered and hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Somebody must see this fire,” he muttered; “but
they will get here too late to save me! The jig is up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was in despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came a sound at one of the doors! Then it was
flung open, and a coughing, strangling girl staggered into
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy Blaney!” he shouted, joyously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come!” she gasped. “Hurry! If you don’t, we’ll not
get out of here! The old building will be all afire in five
minutes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He followed her. The light of the flames showed her
seeming to plunge into the thickest of the yellow, rolling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>smoke. He reached some stairs and fell clean to the bottom.
There she got hold of him and dragged him out
into the open air.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both were coughing, but, as she worked to set his hands
free, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had to do it! It was the only way I could save
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had to do what?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Set the fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you do that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Daisy, you are all right! It was the best job you
ever did!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must hurry!” she panted. “The fire will be seen!
We do not want to be found here! Men will come and
ask questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His hands were free, and he rose quickly. She sprang
up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This way,” she whispered, and he ran after her, as
she darted round the building, from the upper windows
of which there now came a reddish glare.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know how to get away from here,” she said. “This
old building is on the outskirts of the town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He trusted everything to her, and they ran on through
the darkness, cutting across lots till they reached a distant
street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they heard the cry of fire from another direction,
and they knew the first alarm had been given.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few moments later the fire alarm sounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were fortunate in escaping observation till the
home of Daisy was reached.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll not forget what you have done for me to-night,
Miss Blaney,” declared Frank. “You saved my life!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did quite as much for me,” she asserted. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>believe you saved me from a life of wretchedness. You
made me understand just where I was drifting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a brave little girl! I shall remember how
bravely you stood up before those ruffians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But they were too many for me. I could not fight
them all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you know they had me in that old building?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew something was happening. Joe would not tell
me what, but I knew they were going to do something.
I followed him after he left me to-night. I did not go
into the house, though he thought I did. I saw them
take you there. Then was when I made my mistake. I
should have hurried to your friends and told them what
happened, instead of trying to save you myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it has turned out all right. They will think I
perished in the burning building.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She shuddered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the wretches!” she exclaimed. “To leave you
there to be burned to death! I’ll never have anything
to do with Joe Hooker again—never as long as I live!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is not in your class, Miss Blaney. In the morning
both Joe and Sam will be arrested on a warrant I shall
swear out. They will not be expecting it. It will be a
great surprise for them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care,” said the girl. “I hope you will make
them suffer for their dreadful acts. I shall not pity
them one bit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall give them the full benefit of the law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you must go on with your show. I shall not see
you again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be a witness against the Hookers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you want me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“Then you may depend on me. I’d do anything for
you, Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He pressed her hand in parting, bade her good-night
and hurried toward the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the hotel door, they met Gallup and Hodge, who
were coming out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello!” exclaimed Bart. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We was jest goin’ to the fire,” said Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been to it,” said Merry, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it worth going to see?” asked Bart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly think so. It is an old building on the outskirts
of the town. It is not tenanted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not tenanted. Then how did it catch afire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am inclined to think somebody must have set it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, in his room, he told them of the thrilling adventure
through which he had passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do, Frank?” panted Bart,
fiercely. “What are you going to do to the Hookers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give them the full benefit of the law,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They ought to be lynched!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so, by gosh!” spluttered Ephraim. “They’re
wuss’n I thought they was! If ever any critters oughter
be lynched, them is the ones!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sheriff will wait on them in the morning,” said
Merry. “He will serve them with a great surprise, for
they think I am burning in that old building.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning, however, neither of the Hooker
brothers could be found in Carrolton. Whether they
had learned of Merriwell’s escape or not, they had taken
the alarm and fled from the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank made known the story of their atrocity, and
the anger of the honest citizens of the place was great.
They assured Merry that neither of the brothers would
be tolerated in Carrolton again if they reappeared there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Had not Frank felt that any neglect of his present
duties would seriously endanger the success he now
seemed on the highroad to achieve he would have abandoned
everything in order to follow the wretches and
bring them to justice. His future weighed heavier in
the balance than his just vengeance, however, for Merry
was too shrewd and clear sighted to pass over the substance
to pursue the shadow. “True Blue” meant wealth,
the satisfaction of his desires, happiness; the punishment
of the Hookers, aside from its aspect as an act for the
benefit of society, was but the satisfaction of anger, and
nothing more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, early the following morning, Frank and
his company left Carrolton en route for Chicago, where
the real test of “True Blue” was to come. Frank felt
little anxiety as to the result of this test. He knew he had
written a winning play and he believed that at last he had
seized that tide in his affairs that was to bear him on its
broad bosom to fame and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank had experienced adversity in its most chilling
form. Firm and sturdy in his purpose to overcome his
misfortunes, he had toiled with body and brain like the
strong-hearted American youth he was, and now, as he
reviewed the past and calculated his future from its present
promise, he might well say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have won, as pluck and purpose and cheerfulness
always win!”</p>

<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>“The Trials of Commander McTurk”</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The purchase of these stories at a handsome price, for publication
in THE POPULAR MAGAZINE, beginning with the September,
1905, number, is only one step toward the goal we have set
for this magazine:—that is, the best reading matter and more of
it than is given by any other magazine in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cutcliffe Hyne is the author of the renowned “Captain Kettle”
stories, which caused a sensation among lovers of good reading.
We are free to say, however, that “The Trials of Commander
McTurk” will become even more popular because they are written,
at our suggestion, around an ultra-patriotic American character.
We feel certain that the doughty commander will win his way
into a warm corner of every reader’s heart.</p>

<p class='c016'>THE POPULAR MAGAZINE is for sale at all newsstands at
10c. per copy. Back numbers may be secured from your dealer
or from the publishers at the regular price.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
